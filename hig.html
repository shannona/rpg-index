<p><b>HISTORY, 2008-2020</b></p>

Hearts in Glorantha was created by Newt Newport in 2008, under his
d101 Games imprint. It post-dates the golden age of Gloranthan
fanzines, being one of the only such 'zines approved under Issaries'
2005 fan policy. It originally ran five issues, through 2012, with all
of the issues being collected. In 2017, Hearts reappeared, and has
published about one issue a year since, with the 7th issue flagged as
the magazine's 10th anniversary. The magazine was then officially shut down at the end of October 2020.

<p><b>A NOTE ON ORGANIZATION</b></p>

<p>Hearts in Glorantha is a magazine that was originally about the
game HeroQuest and the world of Glorantha. Thus, the majority of this
index is an organization of Gloranthan HeroQuest topics, but they are
nonetheless marked [HQ1] or [HQ2] to differentiate between those and
system-neutral articles. There are also a few articles for other game
systems: [13A] is 13th Age Glorantha; [RQ2] is specifically listed as
"RuneQuest Classic"; [RQ3] is a classic RuneQuest article without a
specific system noted; [RQG] is RuneQuest: Roleplaying in Glorantha;
and [OQ] is Newt Newport's own OpenQuest system.
