HISTORY, 1989-1995

Grey Worlds was originally a fanzine, published by a group of Texas
Rolemaster enthusiasts from 1989 to 1992.  By the last four issues,
Grey Worlds looked extremely professional. The only thing that it was
missing was a color cover and proper binding. After the fifteenth
issue of Grey Worlds, the original fanzine phase of the magazine
ended.

The sixteenth issue of Grey Worlds, labelled "June 1993, Volume I,
Issue 1" was a truly professional magazine, with a full color Angus
McBride cover, a saddle-stitched binding and tons of advertisements.
Although still produced by the Grey Worlds group, it was now being
distributed by ICE.

Three issues of the new Grey Worlds were produced by ICE. Sometime
after that, the company opted to seize publication of the magazine.
Word from the former publishers of Grey Worlds is that it will not
return as a hard copy publication. However, some new Rolemaster
material is now appearing on the Web Pages of the people who used to
put out Grey Worlds:

The former publishers of Grey Worlds can be contacted by email:
rhenton@gte.net (Ross Henton); lemr@gte.net (Lem Richards).

A NOTE ON ORGANIZATION

This index is categorized primarily by game systems. A GENERAL
category also exists for FANTASY.

A NOTE ON THIS INDEX

Only the issues of Grey Worlds easily available through ICE are
indexed here: these are the last four fanzine issues, and all of the
professional issues. I will add the rest of the fanzine issues, if I
can get my hands on a set of them. When referring to issues, below, a
'VI.#' refers to the original fanzine, while a 'VII.#' refers to the
current magazine. It has absolutely nothing to do with the arbitrary
volume numbers which are used on the magazines themselves.
