			  THE VORTEXT INDEX
			     VERSION 1.05

HISTORY, 1991-1993

Vortext was a quarterly magazine that was founded at the start of 1991
by Vortext Publishing. The quality of the layout and articles were
good from the first issue. With #6, Vortext improved the quality of
the magazine by adding very nice looking graphics and interior color.

The content of Vortext was extremely varied throughout the magazine's
history, probably more so than any other magazine currently being
published.

Unfortunately, Vortext ceased publication in Fall of 1993 after the
ninth issue.

A NOTE ON ORGANIZATION

The majority of this index is categorized by game systems. In

FANTASY, SCIENCE FICTION and SUPERHEROES. All of the GENERAL
categories are for articles about the appropriate genre that may be
applied to any game that uses that background.  There is also a
category for FICTION in this index.
