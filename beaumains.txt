HISTORY

Beaumains magazine is a fanzine that was founded in early 1993 by
Gareth Jones. Originally, it was only distributed in Britain, but
recently it has become available in the US, Sweden, and other parts of
the world.

Beaumains is "The Arthurian Magazine for Gamers", and has almost
exclusively been a a magazine about Chaosium's Arthurian game, King
Arthur Pendragon. The last issue of Beaumains published was #5, and it
came out nearly a year ago. However, word is that the sixth issue is
nearly done, and so we should see a new flood of fine Arthurian gaming
material soon.
