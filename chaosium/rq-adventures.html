<p><b>HISTORY, 1993-1998</b></p>

<p>In early 1993, John Castellucci began distributing printed copies of
Escape from Duckland. This was the immediate precursor to RuneQuest
Adventures. The first actual issue of RuneQuest Adventures saw print
in Summer of 1993. A 32 page zine, it presented Escape from Duckland
once more. Up to issue 5, RuneQuest Adventures was published on
somewhat less then a quarterly basis. Between issues 5 and 6 there was
a considerable hiatus. #6 is the last issue of RQA. There was some
talk of reviving the magazine as Hero Wars Adventures after the
release of the new game, but this this has not happened to date.
