HISTORY, 1984-1986

Heroes was a short-lived magazine published by Avalon Hill beginning
in 1984. At the time Avalon Hill was trying to expand into the
role-playing industry through the publication of four games: James
Bond 007, Lords of Creation, Powers & Perils, and RuneQuest. The
original editor, William E. Peschel, produced a magazine that was
occasionally useful. He left after the seventh issue, and was replaced
by Richard Snider, the creator of Powers & Perils. Content and Layout
both deteriorated at that point. Ultimately, Avalon Hill's RPG
experiment was an unsuccessful one, and Heroes lasted only a few
years. The tenth and final issue (labeled Volume II, Number 4) was
published in 1986.

A NOTE ON ORGANIZATION

The majority of this index is categorized by game systems. In
addition, there is a GENERAL category for FANTASY, which is for
articles about the appropriate genre which may be applied to any game
of that type. Finally, the INTERVIEWS section contains interviews with
various game designers.
