<p><b>HISTORY, 1976-2012</b>

<p>Wyrm's Footnotes began publishing in 1976. Originally, it was a
magazine that supported White Bear & Red Moon and other early Chaosium
Board Games. Soon, however, it had become a forum for the discussion
of Glorantha, and Chaosium's first role-playing game, RuneQuest.  By
issue 11, Wyrm's Footnotes officially became The RuneQuest Magazine.

<p>In its short lifetime, Wyrm's Footnotes went through several changes.
The first issue, edited by Greg Stafford, was a stapled fanzine, with
a print run rumored to be as low as 25 copies. For the fourth issue,
Wyrm's Footnotes began using real binding, but it became digest sized.
The fifth issue was again full sized, and circulation had clearly
improved considerably. With issue 8, published in 1980, Charlie Krank
took over editorship of the magazine. Issue 11, of Spring 1981, was
officially labelled Vol. II, No. 1. It sported a full color cover, the
first that had ever adorned Wyrm's Footnotes.

<p>Shortly after Wyrm's Footnotes 6, Chaosium began publication of their
second magazine, Different Worlds. Unfortunately by 1982 it had become
too expensive for Chaosium to publish both magazines.  Different
Worlds continued on, while Wyrm's Footnotes' publication came to an
end. Originally Chaosium planned to publish a series of RuneQuest
Companions. These books were to be 96 page supplements that contained
assorted information on Glorantha, as Wyrm's Footnotes once had. The
first RuneQuest Companion was published in 1983. It was the last
Gloranthan supplement that Chaosium published for 9 years.

<p>Since the first RuneQuest Companion was, in many ways, Wyrm's
Footnotes 15, it has been included in this index, and is noted as
"RQC".

<p>In 1995, Wyrms Footprints was released. It was compiled by Reaching
Moon Megacorp, and distributed by Chaosium. It contains reprints of
many old Wyrm's Footnotes articles, some of them newly annotated or
expanded. It addition, they was a small amount of new material in that
volume. It too is included in this index, noted as "WFP".

<p>In the summer of 2012, Wyrms Footnotes returned one more turn,
courtesy of Moon Design Publications, who produced issue #15. There
was talk of more, but that's been the last issue to date.

<p><b>A NOTE ON ORGANIZATION</b>

<p>Originally, Wyrm's Footnotes was the fanzine of White Bear, Red Moon,
and Chaosium's other early games. However, as more issues were
published, this emphasis began to change. By issue eleven, "The
RuneQuest Magazine" was emblazoned on the cover of every issue of the
magazine.

<p>In compiling this index, I have decided to place this same emphasis on
Gloranthan RuneQuest. Thus, the main body of this index is an
organization of Gloranthan RuneQuest topics. Two appendices follow the
main index. Appendix I contains articles on Non-Gloranthan RuneQuest,
while Appendix II contains articles on non-RuneQuest topics. This
includes ELRIC, NOMAD GODS, DRAGON PASS and many other board games
produced by Chaosium.  It should be noted that NOMAD GODS, DRAGON PASS
and WHITE BEAR, RED MOON all take place in the world of Gloranthan,
and that the information provided in them might be of interest to
Gloranthan RuneQuest players.

<p>Issue #15 bears the HeroQuest logo, but all of the content is system-neutral.
