<h2 class="colorbar">History: 1976-2002</h2>
<div class="white">
  <div id="ToC"></div>

<p>The story of <i>Wyrm's Footnotes</I> begins with <i>White Bear and
Red Moon</I> (1975) a wargame created by Greg Stafford that was set in
the mythical world of Glorantha. Though Stafford had originally hoped
to find a publisher for his game, he eventually published it himself
at a brand-new gaming company: Chaosium.

<p>Stafford began publishing <i>Wyrm's Footnotes</I> (1976-1982+) the
next year to support his new game. <i>Wyrm's Footnotes #1</I> (1976)
included not just new rules for <I>White Bear and Red Moon</I>, but
also some of the fiction and myth that underlay the unique world of
Glorantha. Stafford promised the 'zine would thereafter appear
irregularly, and meanwhile work on the game continued with a second
edition (1976) appearing prior to the publication of <i>Wyrm's
Footnotes #2</I> (1977).

<p>In its original lifespan, which lasted seven years, <i>Wyrm's
Footnotes</I> went through several changes.  The first issue, edited
by Greg Stafford, was a stapled fanzine, with a print run rumored to
be as low as 25 copies. The mimeographed pages allowed the use of
colored paper and ink, giving an extra dimension to the amateur
publication. But, it wouldn't be amateur for long.
<i>Wyrm's Footnotes #4</I> (1978) had a real saddle-stiched binding,
but at the cost of becoming digest sized.  <i>Wyrm's Footnotes #5</I>
(Summer 1978) was again full sized, and circulation had clearly
improved considerably. With <i>Wyrm's Footnotes #8</I> (1980) Charlie
Krank took over editorship of the magazine, for Chaosium was growing
as well. Finally, <i>Wyrms Footnotes #11</i> (Spring 1981) completed
the march to professionalism. The 'zine now had a full-color cover and
was marked as "Volume II, No. 1".

<p>Perhaps more importantly, the content of <i>Wyrm's Footnotes</I>
was changing as well, also due to the continued growth of
Chaosium. In <i>Wyrm's Footnotes #3</I> (1977), Chaosium began
advertising other games they were producing, beginning with
the <I>Elric</I> board game (1977), and even published an article on
Dave Hargrave's <i>Arduin Grimoire</I> (1977), which at the time they
expected to publish. (They never did, and Hargrave went his own way.)

<p>In subsequent issues, articles proliferated on other Chaosium games
such as <i>Elric</I>, <i>Troy</I> (1977), <i>Lords of the Middle
Sea</I> (1978), and others. More importantly, material on Glorantha
began to multiply as well. Some of this was material on the second
Gloranthan game, <I>Nomad Gods</I> (1978), and some of it was more
universal material revealing the background of the world, such as the
"Gods & Goddesses of Glorantha" series that debuted in <I>Wyrm's
Footnotes #4</I>.

<p>However, the most important addition to <i>Wyrm's Footnotes</I> was
material for Chaosium's brand-new Gloranthan roleplaying
game, <i>RuneQuest</I> (1978). It began appearing in <I>Wyrm's
Footnotes #5</i> (1978) with "Geedunk Dungeon", the first adventure
for the new game system.  By <i>Wyrms Footnotes #11</i> what had once
been the <I>White Bear and Red Moon</I> 'zine officially became "The
RuneQuest Magazine".

<p>Shortly after the publication of <i>Wyrm's Footnotes #6</I> (1979),
Chaosium began publishing their second
magazine, <a href="../indie/different-worlds.txt"><i>Different
Worlds</I></a> (1979-1987). Unfortunately by 1982 it had become too
expensive for Chaosium to publish both magazines. <i>Different
Worlds</I> continued on, while <i>Wyrm's Footnotes'</I> publication
came to an end with <i>Wyrms Footnotes #14</I> (April 1982), also
labeled "Vol. III, No. 4" in reocognition of its second year of
magazine-style publication.

<p>Originally Chaosium planned to publish a series of <i>RuneQuest
Companions</I>. These books were to be 96-page supplements that would
contain assorted information on Glorantha, as <i>Wyrm's Footnotes</I>
once had. The first <i>RuneQuest Companion</I> (1983) appeared as
planned, but it would be the last Gloranthan supplement that Chaosium
published for 9 years due to a failed licensing deal with Avalon Hill
that resulted in the publication of <i>RuneQuest 3</I> (1985) ... and
later the death of the line.
  
<p>Since the first <i>RuneQuest Companion</I> was, in many ways,
"Wyrms Footnotes #15", it has been included in this index.  It would
turn out to be just the first of three epilogues to the magazine,
which together would demonstrate the longevity of the Gloranthan
setting.

<p>The second epilogue came with the release of <I>Wyrms
Footprints</I> (1995), an anthology produced & published by Reaching
Moon Megacorp, also the publishers of the groundbreaking Gloranthan
fanzine <a href="totrm.html"><i>Tales of the Reaching Moon</i></a>
(1989-2002). It was printed with Chaosium's branding and ISBN, with
3,000 copies of the 4,500-copy running going to Chaosium for sale.
<i>Wyrms Footprints</I> contained reprints of many old <i>Wyrm's
Footnotes</I> articles, some of them newly annotated or expanded. It
addition, they was a small amount of new material in that volume, as
well as new art by Dan Barker. It too is included in this index.

<p>The third epilogue came with the publication of an actual <i>Wyrms
Footnotes #15</I> (Summer 2012) by Moon Design Publications, a
descendent of Reaching Moon Megacorp who would soon become the
inheritor of the entire Chaosium legacy. It was labeled "Vol. IV
No. 1". There was talk of more issues, but Moon Design eventually
turned instead to the bigger task of resurrecting the
entire <i>RuneQuest</I> game as <i>RuneQuest: Roleplaying in
Glorantha</I> (2018).

<p>Meanwhile, following the initial finale to <i>Wyrm's Footnotes</I>
in 1982, Gloranthan periodical support continued first
in <a href="heroes.txt"><i>Heroes</I></a> (1984-1986), which was
Avalon Hill's house organ, and then in a variety of Gloranthan
fanzines, the first of which was <i>Pavic Tales</I> (1987-1989).
  
<h2 class="nounderline">Theme Issues</h2>  

<ul>
<li>#14 Dragonewt Special (April 1982)
</ul>

<h2 class="nounderline">About the Game System</h2>

<p>Originally, Wyrm's Footnotes was the fanzine of <i>White Bear and
Red Moon</I> and Chaosium's other early games. However, as more issues
were published, this emphasis began to change. By issue eleven, "The
RuneQuest Magazine" was emblazoned on the cover of every issue of the
magazine.

<p>This index follows that later emphasis. It focuses in its main body
on articles about roleplaying in Glorantha (mostly using
the <i>RuneQuest</I> system) and on universally usable Gloranthan
background material.  Appendices following the main index cover "Other
Gloranthan Games" (I), "Non-Gloranthan RuneQuest" (II), "Other
Chaosium Games" (III), and "Other RPGs" (IV).

<p>Issue #15 bears the HeroQuest logo, but all of the content is system-neutral.

<h2 class="nounderline">About the Contents</h2>  

<p>Besides the 15 issues of <I>Wyrm's Footnotes</I>, this index also
covers <I>RuneQuest Companion</i> (1983), which was a new compilation
of Gloranthan content following the end of <I>Wyrm's Footnotes</I>,
and <i>Wyrm's Footprints</I> (1995), which was largely a reprint of
old content. They are labeled "RQC" and "WFP" in the index.

<p>This index has been checked against
the <a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/302365/wyrms-footnotes-1-14-bundle">Wyrms
Footnote Bundle</a> which contains OCRed reproductions of the original
issues. The pagination remains the same.

<h2 class="nounderline">About the Title</h2>

Based on the contents and indicia, the official name of this magazine
was "Wyrm's Footnotes" from issues #1-10 and then "Wyrms Footnotes"
from issues #11-15. But, even for issues #1-10, the use of an
apostrophe was inconsistent on the cover (and in fact issues #2-3 just
call themselves "WF"). The apostrophe-less name was also used
for <i>Wyrms Footprints</I>.

<h2 class="nounderline">Obtaining the Magazines</h2>

<p>Digital copies of issues #1-14 are available
in <a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/302365/wyrms-footnotes-1-14-bundle">a
bundle</a>, while a
<a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/103978/wyrms-footnotes-15">digital #15</a> or if you prefer a <a href="https://www.lulu.com/shop/jeff-richard-and-greg-stafford/wyrms-footnotes-15/paperback/product-1r8g5dk2.html">POD #15</a>
is available standalone. The issues were all originally available
hardcopy, but the early issues are now rare and the later issues are
somewhat rare. The <i>RuneQuest Companion</I> also exists as
a <a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/276223/runequest-companion">high-quality
remastered PDF</a>. <i>Wyrms Footprints</I> is thus the only item not
available digitally, but it's easy to find on used marked for a
reasonable price thanks to its large print run (though you may prefer
the original 14 issues, which have much more content).

<li>Central Genertela is defined primarily as the area in the middle
of Genertela where most cultures are polytheistic. It is bordered
to the east by the wastes of Prax and Pent and to the west by the
Rockwood and Mislari mountains. The primary areas are: Dragon Pass,
the Grazelands, the Holy Country, the Lunar Empire, Maniria, Pent, Prax, and Sartar.  
  <li>A previous version of this article appeared in DIFERENT WORLDS #28 (Chaosium, 1983).
<li>The History of the Lunar Empire was reprinted in HEROES magazine.
    The zero wane appeared in VI.1, the first and second wane in VI.2
    and the third and fourth wane in VI.5. In addition, the fifth
    wane, which did not appear in Wyrm's Footnotes, appeared in VI.6.
  <li>This information was originally published in DRAGONS PAST #3,
    which was included in THE WILD HUNT #38 (APAzine, 1979). Each of these articles
    contains the same basic information, but the later ones (WF12,
    WF13 and WFP) contain expanded information on the years 1611 to
    1613. The last article, in WFP, is comprehensive, containing all
    previous information.    
  <li>Included in "Magical Regiments in the Hero Wars" in WYRMS FOOTNOTES #15 (Moon Design, 2012).

  <li>This information was originally published in DRAGONS PAST #3,
    which was included in THE WILD HUNT #38 (APAzine, 1979). Each of these articles
    contains the same basic information, but the later ones (WF12,
    WF13 and WFP) contain expanded information on the years 1611 to
    1613. The last article, in WFP, is comprehensive, containing all
    previous information.
<li>The History of the Lunar Empire was reprinted in HEROES magazine.
    The zero wane appeared in VI.1, the first and second wane in VI.2
    and the third and fourth wane in VI.5. In addition, the fifth
    wane, which did not appear in Wyrm's Footnotes, appeared in VI.6.
<li>These are compilations of a number of earlier articles from Wyrm's
    Footnotes 9-14. See notes (4) and (5) under FICTION.
<li>A small portion of the "History of the Race of Trolls" was
    reprinted in WYRMS FOOTPRINTS (Chaosium, 1995) as "Famous Dark
