<h2 class="colorbar">History: 1987-1989</h2>
<div class="white">
  <div id="ToC"></div>


<p>Butch (Wheeler), Jim (Mozley), and Mark (Corbett) of Basingstoke,
in southern England, were the "RuneQuest boys". They came together
when Jim ran <i>Apple Lane</I> (1978) after he'd learned the rules,
created characters, and fought some baboons on his own. Mark and Butch
were the only people to show up at Jim's game, because they were
looking for new <i>RuneQuest</I> players.

<p>Jim was probably the one who instigated the idea the idea of
producing a fanzine so that the three could share their love
of <i>RuneQuest</i>, but it was Mark who was the driving force behind
the 'zine, in part because he worked at a printing company. Others
joined such as Pete Cook, a friend from school who drew cartoons.

<p><i>Pavic Tales</I> was the first fanzine entirely dedicated
to <i>RuneQuest</I>. Prior, Glorantha had been the heart of
Chaosium's <i><a href="wyrms-footnotes.html">Wyrm's Footnotes</a></i>
(1976-1982+) house organ and <I>RuneQuest</I> had been an important
element of Avalon Hill's <i>Heroes</I> (1984-1986) magazine, but both
had also given attention to other games from the
companies. <i>RuneQuest</I> had also appeared in individual articles
for any number of fanzines, magazines, and APAs&mdash;of which the
most important was likely Games Workshop's <i>White Dwarf</I>
(1977-Present), which had its own "RuneRites" column starting
with <i>White Dwarf #30</I> (April/May 1982). However, never before
had fans created a magazine all about Greg Stafford's Gloranthan game.

<p>The debut of the fanzine in 1987 as a British publication coincided
with Games Workshop's second big push on <i>RuneQuest</I>. They'd
signed a deal with Chaosium in 1981 to reprint Chaosium's books in the
UK. But by 1984, Avalon Hill was in the driver's seat and had
published their own third edition of <i>RuneQuest</I> (1984). In 1987,
GW started publishing attractive and full color (but poorly bound)
editions of this new edition, starting with <I>RuneQuest</I> (1987)
and <i>Advanced RuneQuest</I> (1987). It seemed like a great
foundation for a British fanzine&mdash;and indeed, <i>Pavic Tales</i>
immediately started playing with <i>RQ3</I> systems in their
"Nysalor's Niggles" column.

<p>The first two issues of <i>Pavic Tales</I> were printed as solid,
saddle-stitched, digest-sized fanzines at what's been described as a
"Christian" printing press. This became relevant with the third issue
because the press operator refused to print it due to Glorantha's gods
and cults, which he'd decided were "devil worship". The issue was
instead photocopied at Mark's work. It's the crudest of the three
issues, just printed and stapled together on the left side.

<p>Eventually, <I>Pavic Tales</I> was able to take full control of the
process with its own "dilapidated" printing press. Quality increased:
some of the later issues were printed two-color annnnd the last issue
made the jump to full size.

<p>The nine issues of <I>Pavic Tales</I> demonstrate the interests of
UK <i>RuneQuest</I> fans in the late '80s. They're largely focused on
adventures and background material for Prax and Pavis. There are a few
cults too, of course, because you can't have a
classic <i>RuneQuest</I> magazine without new, full-length
cults. Perhaps most notably, the first few issues include articles on
HeroQuests. From the start, heroquesting was a big gap in
the <i>RuneQuest</I> rules, fixed in the day only by 'zines and
alternative rule sets produced by fans. Arguably, the second Glorantha
RPG, <i>Hero Wars</I> (2000) gave players the first "official" way to
HeroQuest, but decades later <i>RuneQuest</I> players would still be
waiting ...
  
<p>By the time <i>Pavic Tales #9</I> (Spring 1989) rolled around, Jim
had moved to London, and Mark was carrying most of the load of the
'zine. It became too much, and so he brought it to an end. In many
ways, the ending of <I>Pavic Tales</I> was just as appropriate as its
beginning, for in 1989, Games Workshop published their last RQ3 book,
a softcover of their <i>RuneQuest</I> rules (1989).  by then their
attention was turning to <I>Warhammer Fantasy Battle</I> (1983)
and <I>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</I> (1986). Their <i>RuneQuest</I>
books quickly faded from view, and <i>RuneQuest</I> became available
in the UK only through the expensive Avalon Hill box, which was even
more expensive after it was imported. The salad days
of <I>RuneQuest</I> in the UK were quickly coming to an end.

<p>Fortunately for <I>RuneQuest</I>
fandom, <i><a href="totrm.html">Tales of the Reaching Moon</I></a>
(1989-2003) appeared a few months later. (<I>ToTRM</I> editor David
Hall in fact made his first Gloranthan contribution to <i>Pavic
Tales</I>: the "Unicorn Horn" plunder item found in issue #3.)

<p>For more information on <i>Pavic Tales</I>, read
the <a href="https://www.rpg.net/columns/interviews/interviews93.phtml">2020
interview with Mark & Jim</a> and see pages 131-132
of <a href="https://www.chaosium.com/mig3-the-meints-index-to-glorantha-hardcover/"><i>MIG
III: The Meints Index to Glorantha</i></a>.
  
<h2 class="nounderline">Obtaining the Magazines</h2>

<p><i>Pavic Tales</I> was hard to get back during the height of
Glorantha's fanzines in the '90s, but a few issues occasionally turned
up at convention auctions. It's almost impossible to find today,
likely because it predates the Gloranthan fanzine boom and so was
presumably printed in smaller numbers than many later fanzines (though
big enough to be sold through Esdevium).

<h2 class="nounderline">About the Contributors</h2>

<p>There are few credits on the articles in <I>Pavic Tales</I>, as
reflected in the sparse credits in this index. Mark notes that he was
writing the majority of the 'zine by the run's end. Contributors and
playtesters credited in the issues indexed here include: Iain B., Mike
C., Pete Cook, Mark (Corbett), Andy Cousins, Steve Davis, Karl F., Kevin,
Martin, Jim (Mozley), Simon Phipp, Dean R., Paul Sturge, Peter,
H. Vorder, and Butch (Wheeler).

  
<h2 class="nounderline">About the Contents</h2>

<p>This is a partial index because I don't have the remaining
issues. But thanks to Graeme Murrell for sending me some duplicate issues
so that I could work up a history of <i>Pavic Tales</I> and also index
as much as I could. (A few other issues were were bought at
conventions in the '90s.)

<p>If you have any of the issues I am missing (currently #1, #6, #8,
or #9) and are willing to sell, scan, photocopy, or photograph them
for me for the academic purpose of extending this index,
please <a href="mailto:shannon.appelcline@gmail.com">drop me a
line</a>.

  <li>Central Genertela is defined primarily as the area in the middle
  of Genertela where most cultures are polytheistic. It is bordered to
  the east by the wastes of Prax and Pent and to the west by the
  Rockwood and Mislari mountains. The primary areas are: the Dragon Pass wilds,
    the Grazelands, the Holy Country, the Lunar Empire, Pent, Prax, Sartar, and Tarsh.
  <li>Prax is broken up into seven main regions. Along the River of
Cradles: the Grantlands, Pavis County, and Sun County are all fairly
well defined. Pavis gets an additional, special entry. Everything to
the East of the River of Cradles is called the Wastes. Sacred Prax is
all those areas where the Myths of Prax may still be seen; it includes
especially the Block, the Dead Place, and the Eiritha Hill. Sacred
Prax is considered to extend from the Dead Place all the way South to
the Coast (somewhat arbitrarily). The little chunk of Prax west of the
River of Cradles and North of Sacred Prax is named (originally)
    Northern Prax.
