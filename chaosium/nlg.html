<h2 class="colorbar">History: 1995-1996</h2>
<div class="white">
  <div id="ToC"></div>

<p>Harald Smith discovered <i>RuneQuest</i> (1978) and the world of
Gloranthan in its early days, back when Chaosium still published
<a href="wyrms-footnotes.html"><I>Wyrms Footnotes</I></a> magazine
(1976-1982). Five years on, in 1987, he opted to start his own
campaign. He was interested in the Lunar Empire, but wanted somewhere
with its own traditions, so he wouldn't get <i>gregged</I>. That
suggested the provinces of Holay or Imther. Holay had corn, while
Imther was much more interesting with its dwarves, mines, and
mountains. So Imther it was, which also offered a nice connection
to <i>Griffin Mountain</I> (1981), a book that Smith owned.

<p>However, the background material that Smith had to work with
from <i>Griffin Mountain</I> was scant. It mentioned the date of the
Lunar Empire's conquest of Imther, and the fact that there were
farmers, herders, and miners within th ekingdom. That was pretty much
it, though Smith also had the history of the Lunar Empire in <I>Wyrms
Footnotes</I> to provide some more general info on the
Lunars. Even <i>Glorantha: Genertela, Crucible of the Hero Wars</I>
(1988) would only add a few sentences when it appeared.  Nontheless,
Smith built a Kingdom and a campaign from those scant references and
his imagination.

<p>The Imther Campaign lasted for ten years, through 1997, split into
two parts. The first half was the "Earthwielder Saga" where a set of
scoundrels settled in the city of Hortugarth and eventually came to
quest for a set of four artifacts belonging to the eponymous
Earthwielder. Due to the lack of Heroquesting rules at the time, that
subcampaign came to an end, to be replaced by "The Founding of Amber
Fort", a colony on the Elf Sea, which Smith detailed as "The Imther
Campaign" in <i>New Lolon Gospel #2</I> (1996).

<p>Early on, Smith had a conspirator in his continued development of
the Kingdom of Imther: James Polk. But his creative coterie grew even
more at the first US <i>RuneQuest-Con</I> (1994), which was a pivotal
event for the Glorantha Tribe because it brought together so many for
the first time ever. That was true for Harald Smith, who attended and
met (among others) Mike Dawson and Martin Crim. Crim soon joined Polk
and Smith in working on Imther background. After Smith finally got
internet access in March 1994, some of that Imtherian background then
began to appear on Henk Langeveld's RuneQuest Daily (1993-1994) and
afterward in the Glorantha Digest (1994-2005).

<p>Meanwhile, Smith's connection to Dawson led to his first
publication. Dawson was looking for content
for <a href="codex.html"><i>Codex #3</I></a> (Winter 1995) and Smith
ended up turning it into a "Imther Feature" by offering multiple
articles on the Lunar province. Dawson said he was pleased to debut
Smith to a "non-electronic audience" for the RQ-Con 2 release (1995),
but as it turns out Smith published his own 'zine, <I>New Lolon Gospel
#1</I> (January 1995), at the same convention! <i>New Lolon Gospel</I>
was the fourth <I>RuneQuest</I> fanzine of the era.

<p>(Why "New Lolon Gospel"? Harald was thinking about classic titles
such as the "Jonstown Compendium" and "Notes for Nochet" and decided
to create a periodical with his own city-based name. He'd seen "New
Lolon" as one of just two Imther cities identified in the <I>Dragon
Pass</I> board game, and decided it was a great choice. As for
"Gospel", that suggested both "truth" and religion to Smith, and he
thought those was perfect for the world of Glorantha.)

<p>But the <I>New Lolon Gospel</I> was just part of the picture. It
was meant to contain the in-world information you wouldn't necessarily
find in a gaming supplement, like details on Imtherian food and folk
tales. It was meant to supplement actual gaming books that Smith was
already working on, which were intended to be published as part of
Avalon Hill's "RuneQuest Renaissance". There were two: "Edge of
Empire" on the kingdom of Imther and "Winds of Deception" on the city
of Hortugarth. Avalon Hill signed a contract for their publication in
1996.
  
<p>What no one knew at the time was that the Renaissance that had led
off so hopefully with <I>Sun County</I> (1992) had already come to an
end with <I>Lords of Terror</I> (1994) and <i>Strangers in Pass</I>
(1994). When Chaosium rejected Smith's two books in 1997, because
they'd decided to bring Glorantha back home, it was simply an
acknowledgement of that fact. Meanwhile <i>New Lolon Gospel</I> came
to a premature end as well. #3 had been planned as an issue on
"Magical Ecology", #4 on the Imtherian military and the Civil War, and
#5 on the Conquering Daughter and the Daughter's Road. Though they
would never appear, a few additional articles by Smith on Imther (or
the nearby province of Vanch) appeared in other magazines such
as <a href="totrm.html"><i>Tales of the Reaching Moon</I></a>
(1989-2003) and <I>Enclosure</I> (1997-1998). But that was it for many
years.

<p>Harald's two manuscript had perhaps an even more miserable path
over the next several years. First, Avalon Hill announced in 1997 that
Smith would be revising them without the Gloranthan content. But,
the <I>RuneQuest</I> line was never revived and Avalon Hill was sold
to Hasbro on August 4, 1998. Then, Issaries produced a new Gloranthan
RPG, <i>Hero Wars</I> (2000), and a new fanzine appeared for the game
system called <a href="unspoken-word.html"><i>The Unspoken
Word</I></a> (2001-2004). "Edge of Empire" was planned as the
fifth-or-so issue of that zine and was converted to <i>Hero Wars</I>
as a result ... but <I>The Unspoken Word</I> shut down before it was
published.

<p>Fortunately, there was finally a happy ending 25(!) years
later. After a new Chaosium produced a new <i>RuneQuest</I> (2018),
they also launched the Jonstown Compendium, allowing fans to produce
high-quality PDF and PODs through DTRPG. This allowed (at last) the
publication
of <I><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/421314">Edge of
Empire</a></I> (2022) as a handsome 224-page hardcover POD (and as a
224-page PDF, handsome in its own way).

<h2 class="nounderline">About the Organization</h2>

<p>This index focuses on the content of the two issues of <I>New Lolon
Gospel</I> (much of which appears in the "Cults & Myths"
section). However, this index also includes Harald Smith's other
writings (and seminars) on Imther and Vanch from the time period. The
following six zines and convention books are referenced:
  
<ul>
  <li><i>Codex #3</I> (<u>cod3</U>: Winter 1995)
  <lI><i>New Lolon Gospel #1</I> (<u>nlg1</u>: January 1995)
  <li>The RQ-Con 2 Compendium (<u>rqc2c</u>: January 1996)
  <li><i>New Lolon Gospel #2</I> (<u>nlg2</u>: February 1996)
  <li><i>Tales of the Reaching Moon #16</I> (<u>trm16</u>: May 1997)
  <li><i>Enclosure #2</I> (<u>enc2</u>: May 1998)
</ul>    

<p>See the individual indices
for <a href="codex.html"><i>Codex</I></a>
and <a href="totrm.html"><i>Tales of the Reaching Moon</I></a> for the
rest of the contents of those zines.
  
<h2 class="nounderline">Obtaining the Magazines</h2>

<p><i>New Lolon Gospel</I> was a small-press magazine from the '90s,
printed in small quantities. (The original print-run of the first
issue was 150, but it appears to have seen some reprinting.) It had
light cardstock covers and spiral binding, which probably has resulted
in a lot of copies being lost to the ravages of time. It rarely shows
up in auctions, and so is very hard to obtain. Consider this index
mainly a historical reference and an insight into <I>Edge of
Empire</I>.
