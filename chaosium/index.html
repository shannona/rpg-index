      focused on <i>White Bear and Red Moon</I> (1975), but by the end of its

      a bit of attention to their other early releases such as <i>Elric</I> (1977),
      <i>King Arthur's Knights</I> (1978), and <i>Troy</I> (1977). <br><br>

    A number of additional publications have returned to <I>Wyrm's Footnotes</I>
      over the years, including the <i>RuneQuest Companion</i> (1983), <i>Wyrms
	Footprints</I> (1995), and even a 15th issue of the magazine, published
      decades after the rest of the run (2012). This index covers all of them.

      he said that it would be an "American" <i>Tales of the Reaching

      also remains respected for its quality, at least by those who
      remember it, as its low print counts and its mere three-issue
      run mean that it's largely unknown in the modern-day.

      the Lunar Province of Imther. And he wrote about it, eventually leading

    <p><i>Tales of the Reaching Moon</I> was the most important 'zine in Glorantha fandom.
      Though it started off modestly as a fairly typical fanzine, by the end of its run it
      had become a fully professional magazine. More importantly, <i>Tales of the Reaching
	Moon</I> carried the torch for <I>RuneQuest</I> and Glorantha in a period when the
      game was either not in print or might as well have been unavailable. A half-dozen or
      so other fanzines continued directly in its footsteps.

    <br><br>In the modern-day, <i>Tales of the Reaching Moon</I> has taken over the world:
      many of the current owners of Chaosium came up through the ranks of <i>ToTRM</I>, with
      Rick Meints transforming his work on the 'zine into Moon Design Publishing, and later
      the presidency of Chaosium.

      <br><br><i>Free INT</I> was theoretically a magazine for all of

      number two or three, and the last few releases were simply
      supplements (but still in a magazine style). The major topics of
