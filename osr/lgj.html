<div class="white">

<div id="ToC"></div>

<p>The World of Greyhawk died at TSR in 1993 and afterward was only
supported by fan productions such as <a href="oj.html"><i>The Oerth
Journal</i></a> (1995-Present). But when Wizards of the Coast
bought <i>D&D</I> from TSR, they also brought back the classic
setting. <I>The Return of the Eight</I> (1998), <i>Player's Guide to
Greyhawk</I> (1998), and <i>The Adventure Begins</I> (1998) advanced
past the Greyhawk Wars era to 591 CY and demarcated a new era of
Greyhawk publishing that continued through the 25th anniversary in
1999 and to the end of the <i>AD&D 2e</I> era in 2000.

<p>With the publication of <i>D&D 3e</I> (2000), Wizards decided to
take a new tack with Greyhawk. They turned it into the default
campaign world for <i>D&D</I>. This meant that it appeared slightly in
the core rules, for example offering up a core list of deities. More
importantly, it also became the setting for the RPGA's "living"
setting, where players across the world could take part in both core
modules and regional events, carrying their character from one game to
another. Living Greyhawk (2000-2008) thus beecame the center of RPGA
play. It premiered at the 2000 Gen Con Game Fair with events such as
"Dragonscales at Morningtide", "The Reckoning", and the controversial
"core" adventure "River of Blood". Winter Fantasy 2001 then continued
the fun with "Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil".  Living
Greyhawk built on the success of the Living City (1987-2003) and would
ultimately surpass it, with Living Greyhawk seeing ten times as much
play as Raven's Bluff by 2002.
  
<p>Though the RPGA had their own magazine, <i>Polyhedron</I>
(1981-2002), they decided to start up a new periodical for Living
Greyhawk, the <i>Living Greyhawk Journal</I> (2000-2002), available to
all "guild level" members. It premiered with a short and
flimsy <i>Living Greyhawk Journal #0</I> (August 2000), which was
given away with <I>Dragon #274</I> (August 2000) and likely at the
2000 Gen Con Game Fair as well. Issues #1-4 then followed as
subscription items for guild-level RPGAers. Each ran 32 pages and
included "Campaign News" about the RPGA, "Dispatches" of setting news,
a new set of Greyhawk monsters from Sean K Reynolds, and other
original articles about Greyhawk from luminaries such as Gary Holian,
Fred Weining, and editor Erik Mona.

<p>Unfortunately, the <i>Living Greyhawk Journal</I> ran into problems
with issue #5, originally scheduled as a July 2001 release. Things
were increasingly in flux at Wizards of the Coast under the tightening
financial grip of Hasbro. The fifth issue was thus completed, but
various departments were arguing over who had to pay to print it. As a
result, the magazine sat around for about nine months before finally
being printed in April 2002, to fulfill the RPGA's obligations to its
subscribers.

<p>Meanwhile, the <i>Living Greyhawk Journal</I> wasn't quite dead.
After the production (but not publication) of issue #5, it was turned
into a department in <i>Dragon</I> magazine, starting with <i>Dragon
#290</I> (December 2001), which contained a section labeled as "Living
Greyhawk Journal #6". (That does indeed mean that readers had issues
#4 and #6, but not #5 for several months in early 2002.) As a
department in <i>Dragon</I>, the "Living Greyhawk Journal" was much
shorter, usually running to just two to three articles total. The
'zine continued in a truncated form through <i>Dragon #306</I> (April
2003), which was labeled as "Living Greyhawk Journal #20". But once
more things were changing.

<p>At the end of 2002, Living Greyhawk's player numbers were still
climbing, surpassing the player counts from a year earlier. But
Wizards of the Coast under Hasbro's leadership was also continuing to
cut costs, removing things they saw as liabilities — which would
become a long-standing tradition for Hasbro. As a result, in late
2002, <i>Dragon</I> and <I>Dungeon</I> magazine were both licensed out
to Paizo Publishing. <i>Dragon #299</I> (September 2002) marked the
changeover. With the connection to the RPGA more tenuous than ever,
Living Greyhawk Journal content dropped to just 1 or 2 articles each
issue for its last half year with that magazine.

<p>Meanwhile, as yet another cost-cutting measure, Wizards had merged
the RPGA's <i>Polyhedron</I> magazine into <I>Dungeon</I> starting
with <i>Dungeon #90</I> (January/February 2002). Even though much
of <I>Polyhedron</i> was now focused on the d20 system (originally new
games, but later games such as <i>Star Wars</I> and <i>d20 Modern</I>),
there was still a bare minimum of RPGA content, and that's probably
one reason why Paizo decided to move "Living Greyhawk Journal"
to <i>Dungeon</I> Magazine with <i>Dungeon #98</I> (May 2003), placing
it in the <i>Polyhedron</I> section. As it happens, <i>Polyhedron</I>
(and later <i>Dungeon</i>) was also overseen by Erik Mona, formerly
editor of both <i>Oerth Journal</I> and <i>Living Greyhawk
Journal</i>, so there was also a strong editorial interest in the
setting.

<p>Unfortunately, <i>Living Greyhawk Journal</I> publication was
growing erratic. After appearing bimonthly across its last several
issues in <i>Dragon</I>, it became even more irregular
in <I>Dungeon</I>. Though the content remained high-quality, Paizo
seemed to have locked it down to no more than one to two articles in
those issues where it appeared. Then even that came to an end
with <i>Dungeon #106</I> (January 2004), which contained the final <i>Living
Greyhawk Journal</i>.

<p>The original plan was to afterward publish individual articles that
were "Living Greyhawk Approved", but only one appeared, an article on
Hardby in <i>Dungeon #109</I> (April 2004), which marked the end of
periodical publication about Living Greyhawk (though the organized
Living Greyhawk play would continue through 2008 and the end of <i>D&D
3e</I>). That's not to say that Mona and <I>Dungeon</I> were done with
Greyhawk. They'd just end up producing adventures of their own that
didn't have to be approved by the RPGA, chief among them three
well-respected adventure paths: "Shackled City" (2003-2004), "Age of
Worms" (2005-2006), and "Savage Tide" (2006-2007).

<h2 class="nounderline">Living Greyhawk Journal Issue Cross-Reference</h2>

<p>The first twenty-two issues of <i>Living Greyhawk Journal</I>
(#0-21) were all clearly numbered, whether they appeared standalone or
as part of another magazine. Three further issues are labeled as
"Living Greyhawk Journal" but have no numbers. They've commonly been
referred to as #22-24, as is the case here.

<p>The single "Living Greyhawk Approved" article appeared in <I>Dungeon
#109</I> / <i>Polyhedron #168</I> (April 2004) and is also indexed
here.

<h2 class="nounderline">Obtaining the Magazines</h2>

<p><i>Living Greyhawk #0</I> was likely printed in the highest
quantity since it was a free giveaway. The five subscriber issues
of <I>Living Greyhawk Journal</I> (#1-5) were printed in sufficient
numbers for subscribers, plus a few hundred extra each. They all sell
for low to medium collector's price, but are also available
as <a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/publisher/44/Wizards-of-the-Coast?keyword=living%20greyhawk%20journal">PDFs
from DTRPG</a>. The various issues of <i>Dragon</I> and <i>Dungeon</I>
are not currently available electronically, but tend to sell for low
collector's prices.

<h2 class="nounderline">About the Game System</h2>

<p>This index covers the World of Greyhawk in articles that are either
universal or statted up for <i>D&D 3e</I> (2000). No differentiation
is attempted for <i>D&D 3.5e</I> (2003), which overlaps with the very
end of the <i>Living Greyhawk Journal</I> run.
  
<h2 class="nounderline">About the Contents</h2>

<p>This index uses the <i>Living Greyhawk Journal</I> issue numbers
for coherency of reference, but "Aka" entries list the magazine that
contained the <I>Journal</I>. All of the page numbers refer to the
numbers shown at the bottom of the pages. That's the overall page
count for everything except <i>Dungeon #98</I> (<i>Living Greyhawk
Journal #21</i>), which uses separate page numbers
for <I>Polyhedron</I> and <i>Dungeon</i>. The <i>Living Greyhawk
Journal</I> falls within the <I>Polyhedron</I> side of the magazine.
