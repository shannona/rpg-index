<h2 class="tab">History: 1995-Present</h2>
<div class="white">

<div id="ToC"></div>

<p>Publication for Greyhawk, one of the earliest settings in
roleplaying (alongside Blackmoor and Kalibruhn), came to an end in
1993 with the release of <i>WGR6: The City of Skulls</I> (1993) and
then <i>WGM1: Border Watch</I> (1993). It would never again be seen at
TSR, the original publisher of <i>D&D</I>, with the exception of an
unformatted online release of a mostly complete book, <i>Ivid the
Undying</I> (1995). But as has been the case for many of roleplaying's
most well-loved games and settings, fans took up the slack.

<p>By the early '90s, roleplaying support was proliferating on the
internet.  For Greyhawk that included a classic set of files available
at greyhawk.stanford.edu and a Greyhawk Net-book that was in process.
Unfortunately, much of that early fandom got caught up in TSR's
aggressive assault upon their internet fandom in 1994, where they sent
cease & desist letters to anyone running internet repositories for
their games or settings, making the dubious claim that all of the
material violated their copyright. The Greyhawk Net-book stalled out,
while the Stanford Greyhawk archives were moved to TSR's officially
sanctioned MPGN site, though some contributors angrily called for the
removal of their material thereafter. (TSR's attack on their fandom
was poorly received and ultimately short-lived.)

<p>Fandom was undeterred.  They continued to ask questions like "Who
were the Nine demigods captured by Zagyg?"  and "How did Iuz
participate in the construction of the Temple of Elemental Evil at a
time when he was still imprisoned?" They conversed, they argued, and
they wrote treatises, such as an early piece by Gary Holian on Zagig,
an article that attracted a young college fan named Erik Mona, who
we'll meet shortly.

<p>In 1995, two major new fannish endeavors appeared. The first was
Gary Holian's Greytalk, a mailing list originally run out of MIT that
also spun off into live chats. The second was the Council of Greyhawk,
run out of AOL. An early Council announcement might have stated the
goal of these fannish organizations best, saying it was to "detail the
various areas of Oerth not covered in previous publications".

<p>Soon, the Council would be doing precisely that in a new electronic
periodical.
  
<h3>The Oerth Journal, Volume 1: 1995-2000</h3>
  
<p>In March 1995, shortly after the Council of Greyhawk's foundation,
they announced that they would be publishing a free e-magazine called
the <I>Oerth Journal</i> to the TSR section of AOL. <i>The Oerth
Journal #1</I> (May 1995) followed a short time later, the first of
eleven zines produced by the Council, concluding with <i>The Oerth
Journal #11</I> (May 2000), all focused on the Greyhawk Wars period of
Oerth history using the <i>AD&D 2e</i> (1989) rules.

<p><i>The Oerth Journal</I> had three editors over that period: Steve
Wilson (#1-#2), Erik Mona (#1-#7), and Nathan Irving (#8-11). They
were overseen by the larger Council of Greyhawk, which numbered about
a dozen members at its inception, including two TSR-related names of
note: Lenard Lakofka and Frank Mentzer. As the Council grew more
organized it also began to vote for positions of leadership, with
first Gary Holian and then Tom Harrison taking on the role of
chairperson.

<p>The fact that <i>The Oerth Journal</I> had the support of a full
organization behind it meant that the fanzine didn't fall to the
common problem of one person having to write everything. A small cadre
of members would write for various issues. However, <i>The Oerth
Journal</i> also attracted the attention of past and present TSR
writers. Over its first five years, Gary Gygax, Len Lakofka, Roger
E. Moore, Rob Kuntz, and Eric L. Boyd all offered substantive content.

<p>One of editor Erik Mona's goals for <I>The Oerth Journal</I> was to
bring Greyhawk back as a published campaign setting. That was exactly
what happened in 1998 following Wizards of the Coast's takeover
of <i>D&D</I>. Under WotC's new Greyhawk brand-manager Lisa Stevens,
Roger E. Moore would pen <i>Return of the Eight</I> (1998), with a
research assistant of none other than ... Erik Mona. That would be the
start of a very successful professional career for Mona at both
Wizards of the Coast and Paizo (and was likely why he stepped back
as <I>Oerth Journal</I> editor afterward, though he continued to
support the Council of Greyhawk).

<p>As late as 1999, the Council of Greyhawk was continuing to grow,
with the organization providing their first support of Gen Con that
year. Not only did they host an in-person Council gathering, but they
also ran their first Gen Con adventures: a series called "The Masters
of the Azure", containing "Shadows of Safeton", "Crimson Sails of the
Gearnat", and "The Sacrificial Coast". But that would be the
organization's apogee, and it would be a short-lived one. The Council
of Greyhawk web site stopped being updated right around the 1999 Gen
Con Game Fair. Then that 11th issue of <I>Oerth Journal</I>, which had
been scheduled for October 1999, didn't appear until May 2000. There
was talk of a 12th issue being in progress up through the end of the
year, but it would never appear from the Counil.
  
<p>The reason was some even bigger changes coming out of Wizards of
the Coast:  
<i>AD&D</i> was being rebooted as <i>D&D 3e</I> (2000) and Greyhawk
was being adopted as both the default setting for the new game and the
heart of the Living Greyhawk organized play program (2000-2008), which
gave players the opportunity to play in a constant stream of Greyhawk
tournament adventures. The Council of Greyhawk would dissolve shortly
afterward.  It was ultimately due to the "changes common with any such
organization" being "complicated" by the release of the new rules and
setting information.  Though the Council of Greyhawk web pages stayed
available through at least 2001, by that time there was surprisingly a
new group of creators at the helm of a revamped <i>Oerth Journal</i>.

<h3>The Oerth Journal, Volume 2: 2001-2011</h3>

<p>Nathan Irving, the third editor of the <i>Oerth Journal</I> had
planned to end his run with #10 (July 1999) because he was burned
out. Due to peer pressure, he stayed on to finish that final issue
produced by the Council of Greyhawk, after which he "collapsed". As
the Council was simultaneously collapsing, it could easily have been
the end of <i>The Oerth Journal</I>.
  
<p>Enter Jason Zavoda, best known for
his <a href="https://greyhawkonline.com/encyclopediagreyhawkania/">Greyhawk
Index</a> of proper names, a project that he'd begun in 1998 and would
continue in its first iteration through 2003. Around 2000, he started
what's been described as a "minor flamewar" over how the <i>Oerth
Journal</I> was continuing to lag since issue #10 and suggested that
Irving and his editorial assistants either needed to produce the
magazine or give it to someone else. So Irving gave it to Zavoda.

<p>There was some controversy over this decision, and also over the
direction that Zavoda took the 'zine. He abandoned the regular columns
created by Mona and Irving as well as some of the magazine's
crunch. (In Irving's opinion, he was trying to give it more of a
"literary" feel.) The 'zine's logo went as well. Perhaps most notably,
Zavoda's issues were produced as RTFs without illustrations, rather
than in the PDF format that was gaining momentum. Even editing was
light compared to the previous run of the magazine.

<p>Zavoda's reign as <i>The Oerth Journal</I> editor lasted just two
issues, #12 (Spring 2001) and #13 (Spring 2001), also labeled as v2 #1
and v2 #2. They were rereleased twice that same year, first as
unillustrated PDFs, and then as illustrated PDFs. In the meantime,
Zavoda quit, possibly due to an argument related to Living Greyhawk
and the changes it was bringing to the world.  It wasn't the only time
Zavoda quit fandom, often resulting in the deletion of material from
forums. In this case, he asked for the removal of all the material
he'd personally written for <i>The Oerth Journal</i>.

<p>Fortunately, there was a new volunteer to take over as
editor-in-chief: Marc Tizoc Gonzalez. He rereleased #12 and #13 one
more time, without Zavoda's material, which is how they continue to
exist to this day. He'd then produce two new issues of his own over
the next two years. However, he felt that very high standards had to
be applied to <i>The Oerth Journal</I>, in his own editing and the
overall production, and simultaneously he was growing dishearted by
flamewars in the Greyhawk fandom. As a result he too burned
out. <i>Oerth Journal #16</i> (June 2005) was thus produced by one of
his contributors, Andy Seale, with support from former editor Irving.

<p>Though the period from 2001 through 2005 was a chaotic one
for <i>The Oerth Journal</i>, the 'zine was able to survive in part
thanks to the other digital resources continuing to mature for
Greyhawk. That still included the Greytalk mailing list, but also a
new resource created by Gary Holian and other members of the mailing
list: the Canonfire! website (2001-Present). It was initially a
location to more permanently store Greytalk resources but in time it
would become one of the core Greyhawk resources on the
internet. Irving, Gonzalaz, and Holian agreed that the <i>Oerth
Journal</I> was complementary with the website, so it was quickly
welcomed into the fold.  Canonfire held the <I>Oerth Journal</I>
writer's guidelines and FAQ from early on and even had its own forum
by 2003, while the magazine itself became available on the website
around the same time.

<p>But the magazine and its online home were still changing. In 2005,
Seale's run of <I>The Oerth Journal</I> turned out to be just a
single-issue long. Irving thus picked yet another new editor
for <i>Oerth Journal #17</I> (October 2005) based on him having the
"best vision" for the 'zine. That editor was Rick Miller. Around the
same time, <i>The Oerth Journal</I> got its own website at
oerthjournal.com (though it'd still receive support from Canonfire!).

<p>This was at last a recipe of success for v2 of <i>The Oerth
Journal</I>. Miller would be the editor to offer a long-lived vision
for <i>Oerth Journal</I>, with a reign running for six years,
through <i>Oerth Journal #26</I>.  Under Miller's leadership, <i>Oerth
Journal</I> developed into a modern digital fanzine, with full-color
art and professional layout. His issues generally returned to the
early design of crunchy material such as adventures, NPCs, and gods,
married to gazetteers of Greyhawk lands. Most issues had a half-dozen
or less long pieces.

<p>In 2007, Miller started thinking about a theme that would expand
the scope of the magazine: "Beyond the Flanaess". It probably would
have run in the 25th issue, except in <i>Oerth Journal #24</I>
(September 2008), Miller annouced that the 25th issue would instead be
a tribute to Gary Gygax, who had died earlier in the year. The 26th
issue would then be that long awaited issue on Greyhawk's more distant
realms.
  
<p>But by the time <i>Oerth Journal #25</i> (December 2009) appeared,
Miller had to admit that the previous year had been "difficult". This
was doubtless in part due to the death of not just Gary Gygax, but
Dave Arneson as well. But it was also because both the game and world
that the producers of <i>The Oerth Journal</I> had loved had been
"irrevocably changed". <I>D&D 4e</I> (2008) had been released, the
Living Greyhawk program had been dropped, and none of this was
well-received by the fandom of <i>Oerth Journal</I>.  When
Miller's <I>Oerth Journal #26</I> (October 2011) finally released, it
was almost two years later. It was likely published because Miller had
committed to the topic way back in 2007, but it would be his last
issue of the magazine (though he'd support the next issue of
the <I>Journal</I> and also maintain his Greyhawk website for several
years more).

<h3>The Canonfire! Chronicles Crossover: 2013, 2016</h3>
  
<p>From 2011-2016 was a dark age for Greyhawk and <i>The Oerth
Journal</I>. In fact, the first half of that period was a dark age
for <i>D&D</i> generally, as <i>D&D 4e</I> fractured the
fandom. Meanwhile, <i>The Oerth Journal</I> was almost entirely absent
from the period and its website even disappeared following a hacking
incident.

<p>Fortunately Canonfire! remained available both as an archival
location and a forum throughout the years. It would also be the center
of one last, brief revival of <I>The Oerth Journal v2</I>. That began
around 2009 with the idea of creating a companion magazine to <i>The
Oerth Journal</I>: the classic magazine would focus on the setting,
with longer articles, while the new magazine, called <I>Canonfire!
Chronicles</I> would focus on adventures as well as reprinted material
from the Canonfire! website.

<p><i>Canonfire! Chronicles #1</I> (July 2013) appeared a year and a
half after Miller's final <i>Oerth Journal</I> from editors Dennis
Lovatt and Skip Twitchell. Three different adventures graced its
pages, all still using the <i>D&D 3.5e</I> rules, demonstrating
fandom's continuing issue with the 4e ruleset.  Lovatt and Twitchell
then set forth to produce the next issue of <i>The Oerth Journal</I>,
but it would take almost three years for <i>The Oerth Journal #27</i>
(April 2016) to appear, which was nearly five years past the previous
issue of the <i>Journal</I>. By that point, Lovatt was flying solo,
and he too would soon be gone. That would be the full extent of the
Canonfire-focused rebirth of <i>The Oerth Journal</I> following the
end of Miller's long run.
