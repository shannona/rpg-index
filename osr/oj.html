<h1>The Oerth Journal Index (v1 edition)</h1>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<h2>History: 1995-Present</h2>
<div id="ToC"></div>

<p>Greyhawk, one of the earliest settings in roleplaying (alongside
Blackmoor and Kalibruhn), came to an end in 1993 with the publication
of <i>WGR6: The City of Skulls</I> (1993) and then <i>WGM1: Border
Watch</I> (1993). It would never again be published by TSR, the
original publisher of <i>D&D</I>, with the exception of an unformatted
online release of a mostly complete book, <i>Ivid the Undying</I>
(1995). But as has been the case for many of roleplaying's most
well-loved games and settings, fans took up the slack.

<p>By the early '90s, roleplaying support was proliferating on the
internet.  For Greyhawk that included a classic set of files available
at greyhawk.stanford.edu and a Greyhawk Net-book that was in process.
Unfortunately, much of that early fandom got caught up in TSR's
aggressive assault upon their internet fandom in 1994, where they sent
cease & desist letters to anyone running internet repositories for
their games or settings, making the dubious claim that all of the
material violated their copyright. The Greyhawk Net-book stalled out,
while the Stanford Greyhawk archives were moved to TSR's officially
sanctioned MPGN site, though some contributors angrily called for the
removal of their material thereafter. (TSR's attack on their fandom
was poorly received and ultimately short-lived.)

<p>Fandom was undeterred.  They continued to ask questions like "Who
were the Nine demigods captured by Zagyg?"  and "How did Iuz
participate in the construction of the Temple of Elemental Evil at a
time when he was still imprisoned?" They conversed, they argued, and
they wrote treatises, such as an early piece by Gary Holian on Zagig,
an article that attracted a young college fan named Erik Mona, who
we'll meet shortly.

<p>In 1995, two major new fannish endeavors appeared. The first was
Gary Holian's Greytalk, a mailing list originally run out of MIT that
also spun off into live chats. The second was the Council of Greyhawk,
run out of AOL. An early Council announcement might have stated the
goal of these fannish organizations best, saying it was to "detail the
various areas of Oerth not covered in previous publications".

<p>Soon, the Council would be doing precisely that in a new electronic
periodical.
  
<h3>The Oerth Journal, Volume 1: 1995-2000</h3>
  
<p>In March 1995, shortly after the Council of Greyhawk's foundation,
they announced that they would be publishing a free e-magazine called
the <I>Oerth Journal</i> to the TSR section of AOL. <i>The Oerth
Journal #1</I> (May 1995) followed a short time later, the first of
eleven zines produced by the Council, concluding with <i>The Oerth
Journal #11</I> (May 2000), all focused on the Greyhawk Wars period of
Oerth history using the <i>AD&D 2e</i> (1989) rules.

<p><i>The Oerth Journal</I> had three editors over that period: Steve
Wilson (#1-#2), Erik Mona (#1-#7), and Nathan Irving (#8-11). They
were overseen by the larger Council of Greyhawk, which numbered about
a dozen members at its inception, including two Ex-TSR names of note:
Lenard Lakofka and Frank Mentzer. As the Council grew more organized
it also began to vote for positions of leadership, with first Gary
Holian himself and then Tom Harrison taking on the role of chairperson.

<p>The fact that <i>The Oerth Journal</I> had the support of a full
organization behind it meant that the fanzine didn't fall to the
common problem of one person having to write everything. A small cadre
of members would write for various issues. However, <i>The Oerth
Journal</i> also attracted the attention of past and present TSR
writers. Over its first five years, Gary Gygax, Len Lakofka, Roger
E. Moore, Rob Kuntz, and Eric L. Boyd all offered substantive content.

<p>One of editor Erik Mona's goals for <I>The Oerth Journal</I> was to
bring Greyhawk back as a published campaign setting. That was exactly
what happened in 1998 following Wizards of the Coast's takeover
of <i>D&D</I>. Under new brand-manager Lisa Stevens, Roger E. Moore
would pen <i>Return of the Eight</I> (1998), with a research assistant
of none other than ... Erik Mona. That would be the start of a very
successful professional career for Mona at both Wizards of the Coast
and Paizo (and was likely why he stepped back as <I>Oerth Journal</I>
editor afterward, though he continued to support the Council of
Greyhawk).

<p>As late as 1999, the Council of Greyhawk was continuing to grow,
with the organization providing their first support of Gen Con that
year. Not only did they host an in-person Council gathering, but they
also ran their first Gen Con adventures: a series called "The Masters
of the Azure", containing "Shadows of Safeton", "Crimson Sails of the
Gearnat", and "The Sacrificial Coast". But that would be the
organization's apogee, and it would be a short-lived one. The Council
of Greyhawk web site stopped being updated right around the 1998 Gen
Con Game Fair. Then that 11th issue of <I>Oerth Journal</I>, which had
been scheduled for October 1999 didn't appear until May 2000. There
was talk of a 12th issue being in progress up through the end of the
year, but it would never appear from the Counil.
  
<p>The reason was some even bigger changes coming out of Wizards of
the Coast:  
<i>AD&D</i> was being rebooted as <i>D&D 3e</I> (2000) and Greyhawk
was being adopted as both the default setting for the new game and the
heart of the Living Greyhawk organized play program (2000-2008), which
gave players the opportunity to play in a constant stream of Greyhawk
tournament adventures. The Council of Greyhawk would dissolve shortly
afterward.  It was ultimately due to the "changes common with any such
organization" being "complicated" by the release of the new rules and
setting information.  Though the Council of Greyhawk web pages stayed
available through at least 2001, by that time there was surprisingly a
new group of creators at he helm of a revamped <i>Oerth Journal</i>.
