			  THE PYRAMID INDEX
			     VERSION 1.02

			    [issues 1-15]

                           by Shannon Appel

HISTORY, 1993-PRESENT

Although a relatively young magazine, Pyramid has a long history
behind it. Steve Jackson Games first published magazines starting way
back in the late 1970s, when they took over Metagaming's Space Gamer,
and published it for many years. Although Space Gamer moved on to
other companies, before finally dying the death of too many
publishers, SJG continued publishing other magazines, including
Roleplayer for GURPS, and Autoduel Quarterly for Car Wars.

In 1993, SJG made the decision to again publish a magazine of interest
to the entire industry. Pyramid was the result. Pyramid absorbed some
of the contents of Roleplayer and ADQ, and as a result it does have a
heavy bias towards SJG's products. However, Pyramid has also shown a
willingness to publish articles for other games in the intdustry, and
seems inclined to continue this practice.

This index is now six issues out of date. Distribution of Pyramid in
this area is extremeley spotty, and thus my collection is once more
incomplete. It will be updated as circumstances allow.

A NOTE ON ORGANIZATION

The majority of this index is categorized by game systems. In
addition, there are also a number of GENERAL categories, for
CYBERPUNK, EARTH, FANTASY, HORROR, SCIENCE FICTION and WESTERNS. All
of the GENERAL categories are for articles about the appropriate genre
that may be applied to any game that uses that background. Other
categories in this index include FICTION, INTERVIEWS and SPOTLIGHTS.
