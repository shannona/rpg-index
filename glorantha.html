</p>

<p><b>1996-1998.</b> The Book of Drastic Resolutions, produced by
Stephen Martin, who also edited the RuneQuest supplement Lords of
Terror, was originally seen as a place to collect much of the
information that did not fit into the Avalon Hill book. Thus, the
first issue (labelled volume chaos), was filled with blasphemous
writings about Dorastor, and the cults of the dark land.  Afterward,
though, The Book of Drastic Resolutions became a regular publication,
making it the fifth RuneQuest fanzine.</p>

<p><b>1994-1995.</b> Codex, the third of the RQ fanzines, was first
published in January of 1994, at RQ-Con 1. The first three issues are
of high quality, possessing good layout and interesting articles. for
a while after the publication of the third issue of Codex, word of a
fourth issue would circulate, but it now appears that the magazine's
run is complete.</p>

<p><b>2008-2020.</b> Newt Newport's Hearts in Glorantha was the most
long-lived of the modern magazines. It's hey day was between 2008 and
2012, when it published five issues. It learned returned for two final
publications around the date of its 10th anniversary. The 'zine was
officially canclled in 2020, in large part because Newport had moved
on to other things, including his own OpenQuest game system.

[ <a href="heroes.txt">Download the Index ...</a> ]

<p><b>1984-1986.</b> Heroes was a short-lived magazine published by
Avalon Hill beginning in 1984. At the time Avalon Hill was trying to
expand into the role-playing industry through the publication of four
games: James Bond 007, Lords of Creation, Powers & Perils, and
RuneQuest. The original editor, William E. Peschel, produced a
magazine that was occasionally useful. He left after the seventh
issue, and was replaced by Richard Snider, the creator of Powers &
Perils. Content and Layout both deteriorated at that
point. Ultimately, Avalon Hill's RPG experiment was an unsuccessful
one, and Heroes lasted only a few years. The tenth and final issue
(labeled Volume II, Number 4) was published in 1986.

<p><b>1995-1996.</b> The New Lolon Gospel is the fourth(!) RuneQuest
fanzine. It centers around the Gloranthan Kingdom of Imther, and is
written primarily by Harald Smith. The New Lolon Gospel was first
released at RuneQuest-Con 2 and was originally planned to be yearly,
but only two issues were ever printed.

<i>No Index.</i> 

<p><b>1987-1989.</b> Think Tales of the Reaching Moon was the first
British publication to sport the title "The RuneQuest Fanzine"? Think
again. Over a span of three years, a group of dedicated Brits (Butch &
Jim & Mark) put out nine issues of Pavic Tales, the oldest and rarest
of the RQ fanzines. Mostly digest sized. Lots of Cults &
scenarios. Centered around Pavis. Tongue firmly in cheek. The last
issue of Pavic Tales was published in Spring 1989 while the first
issue of Tales of the Reaching Moon debuted in Summer 1989. Coincidence?

<!-- <font color="#0033FF"><b>UPDATED!</b></font> -->


<p><b>1993-1998.</b> In early 1993, John Castellucci began
distributing printed copies of Escape from Duckland. This was the
immediate precursor to RuneQuest Adventures. The first actual issue of
RuneQuest Adventures saw print in Summer of 1993. A 32 page zine, it
presented Escape from Duckland once more. Up to issue 5, RuneQuest
Adventures was published on somewhat less then a quarterly
basis. Between issues 5 and 6 there was a considerable hiatus. #6 is
the last issue of RQA. There was some talk of reviving the magazine as
Hero Wars Adventures after the release of the new game, but this this
has not happened to date.

[ <a href="totrm.html">Download the Index ...</a> ]

<p><b>1989-2003.</b> In the Summer of 1989, David Hall, Brian
Duguid and Matthew Tudor published the first issue of the British RQ
fanzine, Tales of the Reaching Moon. It was clearly a fanzine,
somewhat amateur, but full of lots of fun Gloranthan material. The
layout and content of Tales of the Reaching Moon improved after issue
one, and shortly it became an international magazine. Issue 4 was
produced in Australia, and currently ToTRM is easily available in all
of Europe, New Zealand, Australia, and the US. 
The later issues of
Tales of the Reaching Moon are of very high quality. Starting with
issue #12, ToTRM has been covered with beautiful full-color
artwork. Tales came to a planned end with #20, after an amazingly
lengthy run for a fan publication.</p>

#1-17. <i>Complete run.</i> 
[ <a href="tradetalk.html">Download the Index ...</a> ]

<p><b>1996-2009.</b> Quite simply, TradeTalk is the sixth(!) of the
modern Gloranthan fanzines.  It first appeared in the Summer of 1996.
The first issue, which was subtitled "Broos in the East" was mostly
translated reprints from Free INT, a German language magazine
dedicated to the sundry Chaosium games. However, with the second issue
Free INT transformed itself, becoming instead the magazine of the
international Chaos Society. Beginning with issue 2, published early
in 1997, TradeTalk was filled with new material and promised a regular
schedule, with the hopeful goal of three issues per year. There was a
long delay between #5 and #6, but Tradetalk seems to be on schedule
again.

<td><p><b>The Unspoken Word</b>.
<i>No Index.</i> 

<p><b>2001-Present.</b> The RuneQuest fanzine world saw a huge surge
in the mid 1990s thanks to the RuneQuest Renaissance then going on at
Avalon Hill. Between 1995 & 1998 many of those fanzines died, as
Avalon Hill support (again) dried up and a new game, Hero Wars, was
announced. The Unspoken Word was the first fanzine to follow that
period, with its entire run dedicated to the new Glorantha game. The
entire run has been dedicated to singular topics, and indeed after #2,
the fanzine stopped calling itself a 'zine; instead we have
independent books such <i>Uz</i>, <i>In Wintertop's Shadow</i>, and
<i>Sons of Kargzant</i>.

#1-15. <i>Complete run.</i>
[ <a href="wyrms-footnotes.html">Download the Index ...</a> ]

<p><b>1976-2012.</b> Wyrm's Footnotes began publishing in
1976. Originally, it was a magazine that supported White Bear & Red
Moon and other early Chaosium Board Games. Soon, however, it had
become a forum for the discussion of Glorantha, and Chaosium's first
role-playing game, RuneQuest.  By issue 11, Wyrm's Footnotes
officially became The RuneQuest Magazine. Wyrm's Footnotes ended
publication with issue 14, though it was followed by the one-shot
RuneQuest Companion.  In 1995, Wyrms Footprints was released. It was
compiled by Reaching Moon Megacorp, and distributed by Chaosium. It
contains reprints of many old Wyrm's Footnotes articles, some of them
newly annotated or expanded. It addition, they was a small amount of
new material in that volume.

#1-6. <i>Complete run.</i>
[ <a href="ybot.html">Download the Index ...</a> ]

<p><b>1998-2006.</b> Ye Booke of Tentacles was the fund-raiser book
for the German Tentacles conventions that run from 1996-2009. It was
produced by the German RQ Society, sometimes branded as Tentacles
Press or The Chaos Society, and thus is a close cousin to
<i>Tradetalk</i>. The magazine was generally <i>large</i> for a
fanzine, with all the issues square-bound and some running more than
100 pages. Although <i>RuneQuest</I>, </i>Hero Wars</I>, and Glorantha
got the most attention, <i>Ye Booke of Tentacles</I> was very much a
magazine for all of Chaosium's games, with <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>
and <i>Stormbringer</I> in particular getting a lot of attention as
well.
