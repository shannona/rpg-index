HISTORY

Different Worlds Magazine was founded by the Chaosium in January of
1979.  Much to its credit, it remained a magazine devoted to all of
the role-playing hobby for its entire life. Issue #38 was the last
Chaosium issue of Different Worlds. In May of 1985, publication was
resumed by Sleuth Publications. After six issues, ownership of
Different Worlds changed one final time. Issue #47 was published in
the Fall of 1987 by Different Worlds Publications. It was the last
issue to ever see print, although layouts for an issue #48 were
presented at GenCon a few years ago. Different Worlds Publications is
still in existence, and offers a selection of Different Worlds back
issues through the mail. However, despite persistant rumors, Different
Worlds magazine has never been resurrected.

FANTASY, HORROR, SCIENCE FICTION and SUPERHEROes.  All of the GENERAL
categories are for articles about the appropriate genre that may be
