HISTORY, 1992-1993

The Last Province was a British role-playing magazine founded in the
Fall of 1992. From the first issue, the 80 page magazine had excellent
articles and layout. Unfortunately, only five issues of the bi-monthly
magazine were printed, the last near the end of 1993.  In 1993, The
Last Province ceased publication.

A NOTE ON ORGANIZATION

The majority of this index is categorized by game systems.  In
addition, there are also a number of GENERAL categories, for EARTH,
FANTASY, HORROR, LARPS, SCIENCE FICTION and SUPERHEROES. All of the
GENERAL categories are for articles about the appropriate genre that
may be applied to any game that uses that background. Other categories
include SPOTLIGHTS.
