			 THE WHITE WOLF INDEX
			     VERSION 1.12

HISTORY, 1986-1995

Before White Wolf Magazine, there was Arcanum, a small fanzine which
appeared in June of 1986.  Thirty copies of it were sold, and it did
sufficiently well that the founders of White Wolf decided to turn it
into a monthly magazine.  Unfortunately, the name Arcanum was already
taken by Palladium, and so a new name was chosen.  Thus was White Wolf
Magazine born.

During the first eight issues of White Wolf Magazine, the magazine
gradually improved in quality.  It started off as a black and white
set of photocopies, stapled by hand.  The first issue actually printed
at a printer was #4, while #5 was the first issue with color on the
cover.  It was also the first issue in which the circulation exceeded
1000 copies (previous issues had circulation runs between 140 and
300).  With #8, White Wolf truly became a truly professional magazine.
It was adorned by a full color glossy cover, and the contents seemed
to be professionally laid out on a computer.

Since that issue, there have been several changes in White Wolf's
format.  Issues twenty-one through thirty were very nice square bound
publications.  Issue thirty-one was the first one in White Wolf's
newest format, one very heavy on graphical design.

With issue 39, White Wolf Magazine finally went monthly under the
auspices of the new editor, Ken Cliffe. These monthly issues retain
the highly graphical design of the earlier issues, but showed a
disturbing trend towards emphasizing White Wolf's own games.

Issue 50 of White Wolf magazine is the last one I bought, and the last
one that is indexed here. Under Ken Cliffe, White Wolf had slowly
become a house organ for White Wolf, and this caused many to lose
interest. With issue 51, White Wolf tried to expand its horizons, by
becoming a magazine all about mod culture. It changed its name to
Inphobia to mark the new era. The experiment was apparently somewhat
less than succesful; current word is that 59 will be the last issue of
White Wolf ne Inphobia.

A REQUEST

This index is still somewhat incomplete, and will be until I can get
information on Arcanum and White Wolf Magazine #1.  If you can provide
me with the appropriate information for those issues (or photocopies
so that I can do so myself), please drop me a line.

At this point, I'm also considering expanding out this index to the
last nine issues of the magazine, since it seems like a fairly small
thing. If anyone has any comments on the percentage of these last
issues that formed useful gaming content, drop me a line.

A NOTE ON ORGANIZATION

The majority of this index is categorized by game systems.  In
addition, there are also a number of GENERAL categories, for CYBER,
EARTH, FANTASY, HORROR, LARPS, SCIENCE FICTION, STAR TREK, SUPER
HEROES and WESTERNS.  All of the GENERAL categories are for articles
about the appropriate genre that may be applied to any game that uses
that background.  Other categories in this index include FICTION,
INTERVIEWS and SPOTLIGHTS.

In REVIEW entries, a number is given in square brackets, indicating
the rating that the reviewer gave the product. These ratings are on a
scale of 1-5.
