			  THE CRYPTYCH INDEX
			     CERSION 1.01

			  [issues I.1-II.2]

HISTORY, 1993-1994

Cryptych magazine was founded in July 1993 by ILM International Inc.,
a Florida group. From its foundation, Wizards of the Coast supported
Cryptych, dealing with sales and distribution. There is little doubt
that Cryptych was originally helped no small amount by the tremendous
success of WoTC's Magic game. From the first issue, the art and layout
in Cryptych were both good. In addition, page count rapidly rose from
64 to 96 pages.

The emphasis on Cryptych was slightly different from the other
industry magazines. Some emphasis was placed on LARPs, comic books,
science fiction and other topics familiar to most gamers. Recently
Inphobia and d8 have both following the same path, mixing role-playing
with other aspects of modern culture.

In addition, there was a concerted effort in Cryptych to bring the
different game publishers into the magazine. Crypytch was full of
newsletters from gaming companies, including big names like Mayfair,
West End and Wizards of the Coast.

Finally, Cryptych also placed some emphasis on more generic articles,
like Different Worlds used to long ago, and as Shadis does now.

Unfortunately, Cryptych suffered the fate of many young gaming
magazines. After just 8 issues, it ceased publication. Volume II,
issue 2 was the last. According to the editor of Cryptych, the
magazine is currently on indefinite hiatus, because the company's
other magazine, Scrye, is taking up too much of their resources. Now,
nearly a year and a half later, it seems unlikely that the magazine
will ever be revived.
