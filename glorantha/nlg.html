<p><b>HISTORY, 1995-1996</b>

<p>The New Lolon Gospel is the fourth(!) RuneQuest fanzine. It centers
around the Gloranthan Kingdom of Imther, and is written primarily by
Harald Smith. The New Lolon Gospel was first released at RuneQuest-Con
2 and was originally planned to be yearly, but only two issues were
ever printed.

<p><b>THEME ISSUES</b>

<p>#1        An Introductory Look at Imther<br>
#2        A Further Look into the Gloranthan Kingdom of Imther

<p><b>A NOTE ON ORGANIZATION</b>

<p>New Lolon Gospel is a magazine abour RuneQuest and the world of
Glorantha.  Thus, this index is an organization of Gloranthan
RuneQuest topics.
However, it also reflects the fact that
the World of Glorantha is now supported by many game systems. Articles
with <i>RuneQuest</i>-specific stats are lsited as [RQ3], while the
rest are generic.
