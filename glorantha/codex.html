<p><b>HISTORY, 1994-1995</b>

<p>Codex, the third of the RQ fanzines, was first published in January of
1994, at RQ-Con 1. The first three issues are of high quality,
possessing good layout and interesting articles. For a while after the
publication of the third issue of Codex, word of a fourth issue would
circulate, but it now appears that the magazine's run is complete.

<p><b>THEME ISSUES</b>

<p><b>A NOTE ON ORGANIZATION</b>

the World of Glorantha is now supported by many game systems. Articles
with <i>RuneQuest</i>-specific stats are lsited as [RQ3], while the
