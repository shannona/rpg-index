<p><b>HISTORY, 1996-1998</b></p>

<p>The Book of Drastic Resolutions, produced by Stephen Martin, who
also edited the RuneQuest supplement Lords of Terror, was originally
seen as a place to collect much of the information that did not fit
into the Avalon Hill book. Thus, the first issue (labelled volume
chaos), was filled with blasphemous writings about Dorastor, and the
cults of the dark land.  Afterward, though, The Book of Drastic
Resolutions became a regular publication, making it the fifth
RuneQuest fanzine.  However, with the release of Hero Wars & Stephen
taking a larger role on the professional side of the business, Drastic
ended after the third issue, which said, "I'm stopping work on
<i>Drastic</i> for awhile. I am NOT declaring the 'zine at an end
[however]." I am.  The Book of Drastic Resolutions was a high-quality
fanzine with professional layouts, and full color covers.

<p><b>A NOTE ON ORGANIZATION</b>

<p>The Book of Drastic Resolutions is a magazine abour RuneQuest and
the world of Glorantha. Thus, this index is an organization of
Gloranthan RuneQuest topics.
However, it also reflects the fact that
the World of Glorantha is now supported by many game systems. Articles
with <i>RuneQuest</i>-specific stats are lsited as [RQ3], while the
rest are generic.

<p>An appendix covers articles on Glorantha boardgames.

(1) Prax is here broken up into six main regions. Along the River of
    Cradles: the Grantlands, Pavis County, and Sun County are all
    fairly well defined. Everything to the East of the River of
    Cradles is called the Wastes. Sacred Prax is all those areas where
    the Myths of Prax may still be seen; it includes especially the
    Block, the Dead Place, and the Eiritha Hills. Sacred Prax is
    considered to extend from the Dead Place all the way South to the
    Coast (somewhat arbitrarily). The little chunk of Prax west of the
    River of Cradles and North of Sacred Prax is named (originally)
    Northern Prax.
