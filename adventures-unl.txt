HISTORY, 1995-1996

Adventures Unlimited was a new, independent magazine that was founded
early in 1995. For its six issue run, it seemed to be quite a winner,
well laid-out and full of interesting and varied articles. The
articles in Adventures Unlimited consist of just that: adventures for
a variety of games. Unfortunately, Adventures Unlimited disappeared
pretty quickly. The company still exists, but currently is only
publishing a miniatures magazine.
