<p><b>HISTORY, 1989-2003</b></p>

<p>In the Summer of 1989, David Hall, Brian Duguid, and Matthew Tudor
published the first issue of the British RQ fanzine, Tales of the
Reaching Moon. It was clearly a fanzine, somewhat amateur, but full of
lots of fun Gloranthan material. The layout and content of Tales of
the Reaching Moon improved after issue one, and shortly it became an
international magazine. Issue 4 was produced in Australia, and
currently ToTRM is easily available in all of Europe, New Zealand,
Australia, and the US.  The later issues of Tales of the Reaching Moon
are of very high quality. Starting with issue #12, ToTRM has been
covered with beautiful full-color artwork. Tales came to a planned end
with #20, after an amazingly lengthy run for a fan publication.</p>

<p>The current subscription information for Tales of the Reaching Moon
is available for FTP from ftp.csua.berkeley.edu in the directory

<p><b>A NOTE ON ORGANIZATION</b></p>

<p>Almost exclusively, Tales of the Reaching Moon is a magazine about
the game RuneQuest and the world of Glorantha. Thus, the majority of
this index is an organization of Gloranthan RuneQuest topics. At the
end of this index is an APPENDIX, where notes on non-Gloranthan
articles are included.


<p>Articles that relate to a specific game system are marked as
such. This index includes:
 <ul>
  <li><b>[HW]</b> — Issaries' Hero Qars.  
  <li><b>[PDP]</b> — David Dunham's RQ/Pendragon mash-up.
  <li><b>[RQ3]</b> — Chaosium'sRuneQuest 3e
  <li><b>[RQ:AiG]</b> — The unpublished RuneQuest 4e from the '90s
 </ul>
<p>Articles without any game system are system-independent.

(1) Central Genertela is defined primarily as the area in the middle
    of Genertela where most cultures are polytheistic. It is bordered
    to the east by the wastes of Prax and Pent and to the west by the
    Rockwood and Mislari mountains. The primary areas are: Dragon Pass,
    the Lunar Empire, Maniria, Pent, and Prax.

(2) Errata for this article appears in Tales #18, page 58.

(3) Prax is broken up into seven main regions. Along the River of
    Cradles: the Grantlands, Pavis County, and Sun County are all
    fairly well defined. Pavis gets an additional, special
    entry. Everything to the East of the River of Cradles is called
    the Wastes. Sacred Prax is all those areas where the Myths of Prax
    may still be seen; it includes especially the Block, the Dead
    Place, and the Eiritha Hill. Sacred Prax is considered to extend
    from the Dead Place all the way South to the Coast (somewhat
    arbitrarily). The little chunk of Prax west of the River of
    Cradles and North of Sacred Prax is named (originally) Northern
    Prax.
