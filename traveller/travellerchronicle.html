<h1>Overview</h1>

<h2>History: 1993-1997</h2>
<div id="ToC"></div>

<p>Just as <a href="mtjournal.html"><i>The MegaTraveller Journal</i></a>
(1991-1993) was winding down, a new <i>Traveller</I> periodical
debuted, Kevin Knight's <i>The Traveller Chronicle</I>, which began
publication from Sword of the Knight Publications around July 1993 as
a quarterly digest — a familiar format that had been trailblazed
by <i><a href="jtas.html">Journal of the Travellers' Aid
Society</a></i> (1979-1985)
and <i><a href="travellers-digest.html">The Travellers' Digest</a></I>
(1985-1990).  Technically, <i>The Traveller Chronicle</I> was a
fanzine, as it was licensed under a fanzine license that had been
issued by Marc Miller himself. Though this classification would
shortly cause troubles, it was a fair description of editor Kevin
Knight's initial intent: he felt that DGP had
abandoned <i>Traveller</I> and that Seeker had disappeared, thus it
fell on fans to keep the game alive.

<p>The release of the first issue of <i>The Traveller Chronicle</I>
could not have been more poorly timed. It was published shortly after
the debut of <i>Traveller: The New Era</I> (1993), but had obviously
been produced prior to the new game's release, meaning that it was
focused entirely on <I>MegaTraveller</I> (1987) and the
Rebellion. Knight managed to turn this into a virtue, advertising
that <i>The Traveller Chronicle</i> was "a magazine devoted to
Traveller in al of its forms". This would prove impressively true,
as <i>The Traveller Chronicle</I> would not only stand astride the
chasm between the <i>MegaTraveller</I> and <i>T4</I> (1996), but would
also publish an impressive amount of Golden Age material.

<p>Though Kevin Knight was sequestered on GEnie, without direct access
to the rest of the nascent internet, that still gave him access to the
HIWG and the HIWG-focused GEnie boards of the era. Thus, some
of <i>Traveller's</I> most notable freelancers from the era showed up
from the first issue: Charles Gannon continued his Diaspora stories
that had been cancelled by the advent of the New
Era; <i><a href="tiffanystar.html">Tiffany Star</I></a> (1987-1992)
editor and <a href="imperiallinesv1.html"><I>Imperial Lines v1</I></a>
(1992-1993) contributions editor Mike Mikesh wrote a Spinward
Marches-focused adventure; and <I>STarport</I> member
and <I>Traveller</I> artist Paul Sanders offered not just art, but
marketing expertise as well. HIWGers James Holden and Mark Gelinas
would also show up in later issues.

<p>However, <i>The Traveller Chronicle</I> may have been most
impressive for how it located and printed a number of
lost <i>Traveller</i> manuscripts. That began in <i>The Traveller
Chronicle #2</I> (Oct/Nov/Dec 1993) with Dale Kemper's look at "The
Far Frontiers", which was setting material that had originally been
intended as a FASA book and that had later been partially released
in <i>Ares Special Edition #2</I> (1983). Kemper's view of The Far
Frontiers was followed by a modern update by James Kundert that ran
into 1995; afterward the sector would be the closest the magazine had
to an "official" setting (though it would always remain very scattered
thanks to its support for "Traveller in all of its forms").

<p>In early 1994, Knight considering expanding the scope of Sword of
the Knight's publications when he was offered an extensive adventure
set in the "Grayln Union". This was to be the work of the TNE-POCKET
mailing list, an internet-based creative collective administered by
George Herbert. The group had begun exploration of the New Era back in
December 1992 with a focus on the Gralyn Union, a Pocket Empire that
they'd created in Reavers' Deep. Though <i>The Traveller Chronicle</i>
had just two digest-sized issues under its belt at the time,
TNE-POCKET members convinced Knight to publish their Gralyn Union
material as a forty-eight page full-sized supplement.

<p>When Knight approached GDW about producing the sourcebook, it
didn't go well, although different parties have different rcollections
of what happened. GDW's Dave Nilsen recalls it as Knight calling GDW
up to say that he was "going to publish various official sourcebooks
on the basis of the fanzine license", while those that Knight later
told about the contact remember Knight saying that GDW was upset
that <i>The Traveller Chronicle</I> was competing with GDW's
own <a href="challenge.html"><I>Challenge</I></a> magazine (1986-1995)
and that GDW was afraid Sword of the Knight might produce better
material than their own. It seems likely that neither of these
recollections is entirely accurate. When GDW's Loren Wiseman wrote an
official reponse to Knight, it simply said that the Graylyn Union
product couldn't be produced under GDW's licensing policy. And so
there was no sourcebook. Some Garyln Union material would instead
appear in <i>Traveller Chronicle #6</I> (Oct/Nov/Dec 1994).
  
<p>The inability for Sword of the Knight to produce supplements didn't
stop <i>The Traveller Chronicle</I> from quickly growing beyond the
label of "fanzine". By <i>The Traveller Chronicle #3</I> (Jan/Feb/Mar
1994), the 'zine was being released into the gaming mass-market thanks
to distributors such as The Armory and Wargames West. What were just
300 copies of issue #2 became 1500 by <i>Traveller Chronicle #5</I>
(July/Aug/Sept 1994). At the same time, the fanzine truly became a
magazine, adopting a full-color cover with <i>Traveller Chronicle
#4</I> (Apr/May/June 1994) and then a full-size with issue #5. By that
point you could definitely classify <I>Traveller Chronicle</I>
as <i>Traveller's</I> sixth fully professional magazine. (In the
process, <I>Traveller Chronicle</I> also removed its "The"; definite
articles have rarely done well in magazine titles, just ask <I>The
Dragon</I> and <I>The Space Gamer</i>.)

<p>That fifth issue also contained the magazine's other Golden Age
coup. It featured the first part of a serialization of "A Pilot's
Guide to the Caledon Subsector", a long-lost J. Andrew Keith
manuscript that had originally been intended for publication by
Gamelords. Paul Sanders announced to the Traveller Mailing List that
Sword of the Knight also had Keith's manuscript for "Letter of
Marque", the famous "Rogues in Space" supplement intended for
Gamelords, so there was hope that there'd be more to come.
  
<p>By <i>Traveller Chronicle #7</I> (Jan/Feb/Mar/Apr 1995), Knight
revealed that the magazine had to cut back to three issues a year lest
their increasing circulation cause them to violate their agreement
with GDW. Likely that meant that they had a limit to how many copies
of their magazine they could produce each year, perhaps a total print
run of 10,000 or so, which would suggest the magazine was by then
doing more than 2,500 copies an issue. This wouldn't have been
astounding given the trajectory of their first year and a half but
would have marked a high level of success for a gaming periodical at
the time.
  
<p>Sword of the Knight was undanted: they started publishing other
magazines instead. <I>The Earthdawn Journal</I> (1994-1997) had
already begun publication in mid-1994 and <i>Shadowland</I>
(1995-1997) for <i>Shadowrun</I> would follow at the end of the next
year.
  
<p>Some remember <i>Traveller Chronicle</I> best for Harold Hale's
"Children of Earth" setting in <i>Traveller Chronicle #10</I> (June
1996) and <I>Traveller Chronicle #11</I> (October 1996), which
depicted the Solomani Rim in the New Era. Hale, who'd done extensive
work for HIWG on the area (and by 1996 was the chairsophant of the
organization) had originally prepared the work for publication by GDW,
but Dave Nilsen had found the Solomani's new empire too large and
powerful in comparison with the Reformation Coalition and too likely
to pull the metaplot in a different direction and had thus declined
the material, so to <i>Traveller Chronicle</I> it went, alongside
Gannon's Diaspora, Kemper's Far Frontiers, and Keith's Caledon.

<p>By 1997, <i>Traveller Chronicle</I> seemed to be reaching new
heights. It was selling the remaining stock for a variety of
classic <i>Traveller</I> products and seemed to be on better terms
with Imperium Games, who had become the new publisher
of <I>Traveller</I> following the demise of GDW. But <i>Traveller
Chronicle #13</I> (September 1997) saw a surprising changing of the
guard, with Harold Hale taking over editorship from Kevin
Knight. Similar things were happening at both <I>The Earthdawn
Journal</I> and <i>Shadowland</I>, each of which picked up a new
editor in the Fall of 1997.

<p>A 14th issue of <i>Traveller Chronicle</I> was largely prepared and
would have included an article talking the increasing problems of
Imperium Games, particularly their poor treatment of freelancers. It
was delayed when word first leaked on Imperium's shutdown in early
February 1998, and would ultimately never be sent to the printer.
  
<p>Instead, those Fall 1997 issues would mark the end of Sword of the
Knight's magazine-focused publishing empire. Apart from the
Imperium-related delays of <I>Traveller Chronicle</I>, the major
reason appears to have been quite simple: a child. Kevin Knight and
his wife (and associate editor) Brenda Knight had a new baby, and
so <i>Traveller Chronicle</I> came to an end. There was brief talk of
a revival under Starjoy Publishing, with Hale still editing, but that
never emerged.
  
<p><i>Traveller Chronicle</I> had lasted from the twilight
of <i>MegaTraveller</I> to the twilight of <i>T4</I>. As such, it also
lasted straight through the short two-issue tenure
of <i>Traveller's</I> seventh professional magazine, <i>JTAS v2</I>
(1996-1997). In fact, depending on how you classify periodicals such
as Steve Jackson's web-based <I>JTAS v3</I> (2000-2016), Mongoose's
book-focused <I>JTAS v4</I> (2019-Present), Far Future's
PDF-based <I>Imperial Lines v2</I> (2014-2015), and Robert
Eaglestone's Kickstarter-supported <i>Xboat</I> (2020-2022), <i>The
Traveller Chronicle #13</I> might have been the last professional
magazine ever published for the game. It was certainly the last fully
traditional magazine.
  
<p>Though Sword of the Knight never finished published the Keith
Brothers' <i>other</I> lost material, Paul Sanders would do so a few
years later as Cargonaut Press.
