      <p><b>1979-1985.</b> Journal of the Traveller's Aid Society, or JTAS,
	was GDW's official Traveller magazine during the classic era of the
	game, edited by Loren Wiseman. It featured regular columns such as
	Amber Zones, a Bestiary, and The Ship's Locker, and also laid the
	groundwork for much of the Charted Space setting. After issue #24 it
	transformed in <I>Challenge</I>. [USA: Illinois]

      <p><b>1981-1983.</b> <i>High Passage</I> was a professional magazine started by a group of high-school friends in a graphic design class. It in fact was <i>Traveller's</I> second professional magazine (and likely third periodical overall). Very quickly the High Passage Group linked up with FASA and the Keith Brothers, who supported later issues, then replaced it with their own <i>Far Traveller</I> magazine. [USA: Illinois]

      <p><b>1985-1990.</b> The fourth official <i>Traveller</I> magazine, and the most long-lived and influential other than <i>JTAS</I> itself. <i>The Travellers' Digest</I> was the magazine of Digest Group Publications, or DGP, who used it to tell the story of a Grand Tour across the Third Imperium. Many of the ideas within <i>The Travellers' Digest</I> formed the basis of <I>MegaTraveller</I>, which was also authored by DGP. [USA: Idaho]

	<i>Traveller-focused Index.</i>

      </p>

<p><b>1986-1995.</b> <i>Challenge</I> not only replaced <i>JTAS</I>,
but it continued directly with its numbering. Its initial intent was
to provide support for not just <i>Traveller</I>, but
also <I>Twilight: 2000</I>. Over the years, it would support all of
GDW's major games and also become a general magazine supporting
science-fiction and horror roleplaying, particularly <i>Call of
Cthulhu</i>, <i>Cyberpunk</I>, <i>Shadowrun</I>, and <i>Star Wars</I>.
Nonetheless, about half of its content remained focused on GDW's own
games.  The timing of <i>Challenge's</I> lifespan meant that
its <i>Traveller</I> support was mainly for
<i>MegaTraveller</I>. Unfortunately, that coverage was very scattered:
the lack of a central focus was an overarching problem for the game.

It was unfortunately short-lived due to the fact that DGP itself was on its way out. The last issue is notable for its inclusion of the Keith supplement, "Lords of Thunder". [USA: Oregon]

      Mikesh, and John Meyers. The initial issue debuted
      with <I>Assignment Vigilante</I> (1992), but GDW soon proved
      unable to mail it due to financial problems at the time.

	resurrecting Golden Age projects such as "A Pilot's Guide to
	the Caledon Subsector" and "The Far Frontiers" and providing a
	home to New Era projects such as "Children of Earth". It was
	truly a magazine for "Traveller in all of its forms".

      <p><b>1996-1997.</b> Though it continued the number from
      GDW's <i>JTAS v1</I>, <i>JTAS v2</I> was a very different
      magazine, not just because of its focus on <i>T4</I> (1996), but
      also because of its production team's relative inexperience
      with <i>Traveller</I>, its focus on fiction, its numerous
      controversies, and ultimately its very short run. <i>JTAS v2</I>
      would be an ignoble end to a long history of
      professional <i>Traveller</I> periodicals.

	Staple</I> and <I>Security Leak</I>, though it was more
	long-lived than either (and is generally considered one of the
	top 'zines of the era). <i>Third Imperium</I> focused on the
	Trojan Reach, and much of Jackson's work on the sector remains

      of <i>Continuum</I> was dominated by the announcements
      of <I>MegaTraveller</i>, released at the end of the year: by
      that time, <i>Continuum</I> was gone, as it published in just

      <p><b>2009-Present.</b> <i>Freelance Traveller</I> was founded
	by Jeff Zeitlin in 1994 or 1995 as a website intended to
	collect together original articles about the <i>Traveller</I>
	RPGs and Charted Space. In 2009 he tried a new experiment:
	collecting together articles into a PDF 'zine, which he
	called <i>Freelance Traveller Magazine #0</I>. The experiment
	was successful, and </I>Freelance Traveller</I> has been
	running ever since, first on a monthly, then a bimonthly
	schedule. With over 100 issues under its belt, it's by far the
	longest-lived Traveller periodical of any sort.
