<h1>Overview</h1>

<h2>History: 1984-1985</h2>
<div id="ToC"></div>

<p><i>Working Passage</I> wasn't the first Traveller fanzine. Two
predated it: the fanzine <a href="alienstar.html"><i>Alien
Star</I></a> (1981-1982) and the
newsletter <a href="darkstar.html">Dark Star</a></I> (1981), both produced
in the UK a few years earlier. However, <I>Working Passage</I> would
become a foundational building block in Traveller fandom in a way that
neither of its predecessors had, and that was in large part due to its
editor: Ed Edwards.

<p>Edwards entered gaming as a wargamer, cutting his teeth
on <I>Tactics II</I> (1958) in 1959 and then becoming a more serious
collector of wargames beginning in 1976. He was a particular fan of
SPI and when that company fell in 1982, he turned to other
hobbies. He'd long known about <i>Traveller</i>, having bought his
brother a copy in 1977, and now he decided to give it a try himself
with his first purchase being <i>Traveller Supplement 8: Library Data
(A-M)</i> (1981). Though he hadn't been a particular fan of
the <i>Traveller</I> game system, the background of the Third Imperium
won him over.

<p>Edwards was definitely a collector. By the end of 1982, he had 40
Traveller supplements. <I>Book 5: High Guard</I> (1980), bought that
December, was a particular prize because Edwards loved the solo-play
ship-design system; he filled notebooks with his own starships. By the
end of 1983, Edwards had 116 Traveller products. By 1984, Edwards was
selling off his wargame collection to pay for Traveller products. He'd
have 175 by the end of that year.

<p>As a fan, Edwards began reviewing Traveller products for <i>The
American Wargamer</I> (1973-2000), starting in late 1983. As a
collector, he began producing lists of Traveller products as well. At
Origins '84, he discovered many Traveller fans had such lists, and
declared himself coordinator of the Traveller Data Base Working Group,
intended to produce a variety of lists relevant to Traveller. By the
end of the month he'd bought a Commodore 64 computer so that he could
better produce the lists and even write a short newsletter for other
people working on the lists: the <I>Traveller Data Base
Express</I>. Brian Sarver, Steve Tingley, and even Marc Miller all
supported early lists for the data base project.

<p>Though Steve Tingley had just a single list under his purview for
the TDBWG, the Skills List (TDB #14), he would quickly become central
to the story of <i>Working Passage</i>. This began in September 1984,
when Tingley and Edwards tested out the design of a new "Newsletter
for Traveller Fans", inspired by <I>The American Wargamer</I> and the
work of its editor, George Phillies. That newsletter was, of
course, <i>Working Passage</i>. Edwards was the editor of the
newsletter, responsible for putting it together, while Tingley was the
publisher, responsible for printing and distributing it. Their first
test issue, labeled "Vol 0, #1" was never widely distributed, although
at least one copy made it out beyond Edwards' and Tingley's local
friends. It consisted of an introduction, a listing of Traveller Data
Base (TDB) lists, and a few reviews that would later be reprinted.

<p>The real start of <i>Working Passage</I> was issue "#0", produced
in November. It demonstrated a new two-column layout and was printed
at 12 pages (likely six double-sided photocopied pages, and likely
meant to weigh just less than an ounce, to keep the newsletter in the
cheapest mailing rate for personal mail: 22 cents for first
class). Like <i>Dark Star</I> before it, <i>Working Passage</I> was
more a newsletter than a fanzine, meaning that both the layout and the
content were on the less polished side, and that there tended to be a
higher proportion of reviews and news. Nonetheless, it had a fair
amount of gaming content.

<p>Working Passage</I> ran approximately monthly for twelve issues
from November 1984 through December 1985. They were almost all 12
pages long, with just a few discrepencies near the end of the
run. Popular topics included starship design (which remained a
favorite for Edwards) and the stories of an "average" character
(777777) named ED172ed and his homebase on Dock 137. <i>Working
Passage</I> also featured many of the data bases created by the TDBWG;
it more officially became the home of the TDBWG with issue #7 (August
1985), when it incorporated the <i>TDB Express</i>.

<p>One other important element of <I>Working Passage</I> was its use
of digitally created
illustrations. The <a href="travellers-digest.html"><i>Travellers'
Digest</I></a> usually gets the credit for having some of the earliest
digital illustrations in the entire roleplaying industry,
but <i>Working Passage</I> trailed them by just a single month with a
digital illustration of "Sword Base" by Pat Stapleton appearing
in <I>Working Passage #6</i> (July 1985).
  
<p>Steve Tingley only supported <I>Working Passage</I> through issue
#3 (March 1985) after which Edwards was abruptly required to take over
the actual publication of the magazine. After that the magazine was
almost entirely his work, though he had some help. That after all was
the name of the magazine: "Working Passage" was meant to suggest that
readers would provide their own work to help support the magazine.
Marc Miller thus offered an early look at Deneb's maps in issue #2
(February 1985), a rather extraordinary act of kindness toward such a
small, amateur fanzine -- but such support of small Traveller press
was quite typical for Miller, and likely one of the reasons for the
game's success. Other contributors such as Craig Sheeley and Herb
Petro would later move on to other publications.

<p>There were plans to do more. In <i>Working Passage #8</I>
(September 1985), Edwards talked about the formation of "Universal
Gaming Experiences", a new publisher intended to produce "Approvedd
For" products for Traveller as well as Car Wars and The Morrow Project
and even their own game "To Challenge Infinity". They would never
appear; in fact, <i>Working Passage</I> would soon come to an end.
  
<p>After the publication of <I>Working Passage #11</I> (December
1985), Edwards planned to begin work on Working Passage #12 on
December 27, 1985 and then after a break for his wife's surgery in
January 1986 continue on with issues #14 and #13, the latter to fall
on April Fools' Day 1986. It was not to be: on January 9, 1986, Herb
Petro received a letter from Edwards telling him that Edwards'
Commodore 64 had broken down, and there was no money to repair
it. <I>Working Passage</I> was thus ending its production.

<p>But, Edwards had done more than just create a magazine: he'd
created a community. He'd already offered Magnus Abel encouragement in
the creation of what would be Traveller's fourth fanzine, <I>Between
Worlds</I> (1985-1986), which Herb Petro said was "half a step above
Working Passage (sorry Ed)" in a review. Following the end
of <i>Working Passage</I>, Petro himself picked up the baton to create
its direct successors: first <a href="tis.html"><i>The Imperium
Staple</I></a> (1986-1987) and
then <a href="continuum.html"><i>Continuum</I></a> (1987). A few
columns continued over from <i>Working Passage</I> to the new
magazines, as did the presence of both Petro and Edwards.
  
<p>With the advent of <i>Working Passage</i> in 1984, Edwards had thus
created the first <i>Traveller</I> fandom of correspondents and
amateur publishers.  And, he wasn't done yet. In 1987 he became the
most important person in Traveller fandom again when he founded the
History of the Imperium Working Group (HIWG) with the support of Mike
Mikesh, but that story lies in the history
of <a href="tiffanystar.html"><i>Tiffany Star</I></a> (1987-1992).

<h2 class="nounderline">Obtaining the Magazines</h2>

<p>The 0th issue of <i>Working Passage</I> was intended to go out 268
readers, based on a list Edwards and Tingley had generated of "friends
of Traveller". Unfortunately, Edwards and Tingley didn't have the
money to do so. In fact, the total treasury of <I>Working Passage</I>
for the first issue was $20, the sum of the subscription fees paid by
Edwards and Tingley ($10 each for 12 issues), since "Working Passage"
meant that everyone had to pay, even the editor and publisher. The
first issue thus went out to a much smaller set of potential
subscribers, ultimately limiting the reach of the magazine. By the
final issue, <i>Working Passage</I> had a subscription list of
approximately 60 readers, some of them comps.

<p>Edwards did photocopy old issues for new readers. However, the fact
that it was a plain newsletter, and that it went out to a fairly small
number of subscribers, means that there are probably very few issues
left extant today. It's also never been reproduced on the internet.

<p>As a result, this index is primarily a historical document that
records what <I>Working Passage</i> was, as opposed to an index that
might be useful for actual printed copies.

<h2 class="nounderline">Special Thanks</h2>

<p>Special thanks to Art Gorski who sold me a complete run
of <I>Working Passage</I> that he'd bought from Herb Petro. It
contained not just the 12 issues of <I>Working Passage</I> but also
that test print from September 1984, the final subscriber's list, and
a few other pieces of historic interest.

<p>Thank you, Art! Obviously that collection of <I>Working Passage</I>
was invaluable for producing this, but moreso it revealed lots of good
content for the <i>Traveller</I> history book I'm working on, <i>This
is Free Trader Beowulf</I>, which is of course the point of the whole
exercise!
