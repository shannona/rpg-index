<h1>Overview</h1>

<h2>History: 1989-1997</h2>
<div id="ToC"></div>

<p>Jae Campbell bought the classic <I>Traveller</I> (1977) boxed set
sometime in 1977 or 1978 and ran a campaign for years ... until he
moved to London where new job requirements forced him to set it
aside. A decade on, this put him in a unique situation: whereas many
classic players were put off by the setting changes
of <I>MegaTraveller</I> (1987), that was the game that brought
Campbell back into the fold!  Within a year he was thinking about
creating a fanzine focused on the "unaligned worlds" on the Rimward
side of the Spinward Marches.

<p>Enter HIWG, which was formed in 1987 as a fan-group focused on
detailing the Third Imperium during the Rebellion. In late 1988,
Campbell saw an advertisement from Duncan Law-Green inviting British
players to join HIWG-UK. He responded and was invited by Law-Green to
join the work developing the Dagudashaag Sector. Suddenly, Campbell's
ideas for a fanzine had a new focus: Dagudashaag, not the Spinward
Marches, leading to the publication of <I>Signal-GK #1</i> (1989).

<p>Despite its connections to HIWG-UK and its development of one of
the four Vland-domain sectors that had been turned over to the
organization,
<i>Signal-GK</I> was not an official HIWG 'zine. The
"acknowledgements" at the start of each issue made that clear:
"Although Signal-Gk is acknowledged by HIWG and GDW the data shown is
not 'official' - Players wishing to know the official status of any
item or article should contact GDW or the Dagudashaag Sector Analyst,
Duncan Law-Green directly." But, more than that, <I>Signal-GK</I>
wasn't <i>like</I> the HIWG 'zines such
as <a href="tiffanystar.html"><i>Tiffany Star</I></a> (1987-1992)
or <i>AAB Proceedings</I> (1989-1999). Where the typical HIWG 'zine
was full of conversation, discussion, and other
"analysis", <I>Signal-GK</I> was instead a player-focused fanzine
like <a href="tis.html"><I>The Imperium Staple</I></a> (1986-1987)
or <a href="thirdimperium.html"><i>Third Imperium</i></a> (1986-1988),
full of ready-to-game content.

<p>But <i>Signal-GK</I> wasn't exactly a typical fanzine
either. That's in large part because it was the product of a team, not
a single creator. To be precise, it was the product of the "Dag Dev
Team", which included Duncan Law-Green, Jae Campbell, Leighton
Piper. Adie Stewart, and Stuart Machin, with Nick
Walker.

<p>Where <i>Signal-GK</I> was more typical was in their depiction of a
sector, one subsector per issue, as had been done as far back
as <a href="highpassage.html"><i>High Passage</I></a>
(1981-1983). There were even plans to eventually collect all of the
core Dagudashaag information in an "Encyclopedia Dagudashaag". This
would have been a milestone for fanzines (as none of the others doing
this sort of work had ever completed the detailing of their sector)
and for HIWG (as much of their analyst material was ultimately
unpolished or even unfinished).

<p>Starting with #1, each issue of <I>Signal-GK</I> included an insert
detailing a subsector of Dagudashaag through Library Data, Subsector
Map, and UWPs. These were supplemented by WarZones by Stuart Machin
that depicted battles of the Rebellion, as well as adventures, Ports
of Call detailing individual planets, INDISS News revealing happenings
in the sector, and Legends & Lore with Amber Zone–like ideas with a
strong historical basis. In other words, each issue had a tight focus
on a subsector, offering a variety of gameable information.

<p>In the middle of <I>Signal-GK's</I> run, it tried twice to
supplement its Dagudashaag content with that of more distant
realms. That began in <I>Signal-GK #6</I> (1992), which included some
content for the Theta Borealis sector. This was the result of
discussions at the HIWG(UK) Con in 1991 where members decided that an
area was needed as a "learning ground for new players" that would be
"simpler" to digest. Theta Borealis had won out because of its
distance from the Imperium while still having some contact with Aslan
and Zhodani, and because it was largely undocumented (other than Group
One material that was to be ignored). A few Theta Borealis articles
continued through <I>Signal-GK #8</I> (1993) and the project was also
supported through at least one issue of a 'zine put out by Ian Steads
called <i>Megatraveller Information Notes</I> (1991), the first issue
of which was distributed with <I>STarport</I> (1989-1991).

<p>The other new setting was the Hubworlds. This was a project
initiated by Mike Mikesh, who wanted HIWG to detail a Pocket Empire
for use with <I>Traveller: The New Era</I> (1993). He was handed part
of the Massilia Sector for this usage, and so he brought in HIWG UK,
because of its near proximity to the organization's Domain of
Vland. The Pocket Empire was then developed by members of HIWG, HIWG
UK, and <i>Signak-GK</I>. It was originally planned for publication
in <I><a href="imperiallinesv1.html">Imperial Lines #6</a></i>, but
when GDW's newsletter was cancelled, it ended up in the main <i>New
Era</I> rulebook instead. <I>Signal-GK #7</I> (1993) had a few
additional details on the setting, with content continuing into the
next issue, before <I>Signal-GK #9</I> (1994) revealed that readers
wanted the magazine focused back on Dagudashaag (which had also
continued as the main content for the previous two issues).

<p>There was another big change over that same span of issues. Jae
Campbell was stepping down as editor of <i>Signal-GK</I>. Though he'd
later say it had been a "bad year", one of Campbell's prime reasons
for his deprture was "concern that GDW was ignoring all the hard work"
of HIWG (and <I>Signal-GK</i>) as it jettisoned its traditional
setting for the New Era.

<p>Leighton Piper took over as editor of <I>Signal-GK</I> with issue
#8 (though Campbell would remain to help with production). Piper had
discovered RPGs through <i>D&D</I> (1974) in 1979, but soon after
found <i>Traveller</I> as well. Like Campbell, he'd taken a break from
gaming in the '80s, and like Campbell he returned to <I>Traveller</I>
with the <i>MegaTraveller</I> rules. He was soon playing again, and
then began looking for a way to "distribute" his ideas, which led him
to HIWG and <I>Signal-GK</i>.
  
<p>Unfortunately, <i>Signal-GK</i> began to slow down with issue #10
(1995), one of just two issues published in 1995. Only a few more
issues would follow, through 1997. Perhaps recognizing the danger of
the magazine coming to a premature end, Piper began to double up on
subsectors starting with <I>Signal-GK #11</I> (1995). That meant with
the publication of <i>Signal-GK #13</I> (1997), the entirety of
Dagudashaag had been detailed, the first time a fanzine had succeeded
at that goal!

<p>And it was a good thing, because <I>Signal-GK</I> was at its
end. Piper noted that Campbell was preparing to step back from his
production work with #14. Not only did #13 only appear in electronic
form, but there would not be another issue: the story
of <i>Signal-GK</I> was ended. Though Piper had noted that the
long-planned Dagudashaag Encyclopedia was "gathering pace", it
wouldn't appear either.

<p>At the time.

<p><i>Signal-GK</I> was one of <i>Traveller's</i> most far-reaching
'zines, as it began in the <i>MegaTraveller</I> era and continued
through the <i>Traveller: The New Era</I> era and into the <i>T4</I>
year. This was similar to the story
of <a href="travellerchronicle.html"><i>Traveller Chronicle</I></a>
(1993-1997), except for the fact that <i>Signal-GK</I> stayed loyal
mainly to <i>MegaTraveller</I> and the Rebellion across its run, with
its articles about <I>The New Era</I> being mainly flirtations.

<p><i>Signal-GK</I> also revealed another <i>Traveller</I> trend
across those years. Where it started out as an offshoot of HIWG, by
the final issues it was featuring authors such as Martin Dougherty, Jo
Grant, and Andy Lilly, who would be the faces of the <I>next</I> major
fan organization in the UK: BITS.

<p>Around 2006, Piper returned at the head of a "Resurrection Team" for
<i>Signal-GK</I>, which also included Scott Martin, Ewan Quibell, and
Richard Ais. Over the next several years, he remastered the first five
issues of <i>Signal-GK</I>, creating new digital versions of each
issue that also incorporated the subsector booklets for each issue. By
2011, the Resurrection Team had made those five remastered issues
available for free download off of a website, alongside digital scans
of the rest of the run (with a few of the booklets missing, most
notably the one detailing the Kuriishe Subsector [K]). The
long-awaited
<i>Encyclopedia Dagudashaag</i> (2017) soon made its appearance as
well.

<p>The Signal-GK website disappeared in 2020 or 2021, but the five
remastered issues and scans of the rest of the run remain available at
the <a href="https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Signal-GK/issues">Traveller
Wiki</a>, as does
the <a href="https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/File:Encyclopaedia_Dagudashaag.pdf"><i>Encyclopedia
Dagudashaag</i></a>.

<h2 class="nounderline">About the Contents</h2>

<p>This index is based on the issues of <I>Signal-GK</I> as they
currently exist at
the <a href="https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Signal-GK/issues">Traveller
Wiki</a>, because those are the copies of the issues that are
available to readers today. The pagination of the index is thus
specific to the PDFs available at that site.

That means:
<ul>
  <li>Issues #1-5 are based on the remastered issues.
  <li>Issues #8-12 all show the insert booklets incorporated into the main page count, though they're still marked as an [i] to make it obvious they were separate booklets originally.
  <li>Issues #6-7 & #13 show the library data inserts as separate books.
  <li>The Kuriishe Subsector is based on the "PDF Reconstruction" available at the Wiki.
  <li>Certain elements that were originally separate booklets are missing from issues #6-13.
</ul>    
  
<p>The missing content is known to include WarZone articles from issue
#6-9, starship designs from those same issues, and "Language Notes"
from issue #9.

<p><i>I am seeking a better scan of the issue #13 cover. If you can
scan it, please send mme an image
