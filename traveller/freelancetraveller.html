<h1>Overview</h1>

<h2>History: 2009-Present</h2>
<div id="ToC"></div>

<p><i>Freelance Traveller</i> is not only the longest-running fanzine
ever published for <I>Traveller</I>, but it's also likely the
longest-running fansite for <i>Traveller</I>, and for that matter the
longest-running <I>Traveller</I> entity of any type.

<p>Editor Jeff Zeitlin wrote in <i>Freelance Traveller #0</I>
(November 2009) that his Freelance Traveller website had already been
around for 15 years by that point, which would date it to late 1994 or
early 1995. At that time, GDW, the original publisher
of <I>Traveller</I>, was still in existence and <i>Traveller: The New
Era</I> (1993) was still in print as the (mere) third iteration of
the <I>Traveller</I> game. It was a different time.

<p>In the beginning, Freelancer Traveller was merely a website, not a
fanzine. But it was a website that ran articles from a variety of
writers. It actively sought them out, asking for permission to reprint
from sources such as the Traveller Mailing List and even from some
fanzines of the final era of print 'zines, such as <I>Dark Star II</I>
(1996).

<p>The website and its collection of articles ran on a variety of
hosted URLs, most of them lost to the mists of time. However around
1998 it settled on the biggest <I>Traveller</I> website of the era,
Downport, alongside other <i>Traveller</I> websites such as History of
the Imperium Working Group, the Eaglestone Collection, Andrew
Moffatt-Vallance's vehicles and weapons, Stuart Ferris' World Builder
Deluxe / Heaven & Earth software, and Lewis Roberts' BARD Pages. (Many
more would follow.) Around the same time, writers began to proactively
submit articles to Freelance Traveller, so that Zeitlin didn't have to
track them down on his own. In December 2001 Freelance Traveller
finally acquired its own
URL: <a href="https://www.freelancetraveller.com/">freelancetraveller.com</a>,
which it was using by early 2002.

<p>As the '90s passed into the '00s, the Long Night fell
on <i>Traveller</I>. GDW's pseudo-successor Imperium Games went out of
business and with it, publication of the <i>Traveller</I> game system
came to an end (though the universe of Charted Space continued using
other RPG systems such as GURPS, Hero, and d20). <i>Traveller's</I>
rich universe of fanzines died out as well, with HIWG-focused
fanzines such as <i>AAB Proceedings</I> (1989-1999), <i>Starburst</I>
(1991?-1999), and <i>The Meshan Saga</I> (1995-1999) being the last to
fall. <I>Freelance Traveller</I>, with its regularly updated web-based
articles and news, was the closest thing to a fanzine between the
death of the final HIWG 'zines in 1999 and the rise of <i>Stellar
Reaches</I> (2005-2018?) as the first of many digital PDF 'zines
half-a-decade later.

<p>In 2008, the Long Night came to an end with the publication of the
first edition of a new <i>Traveller</I> RPG from Mongoose
Publishing. Combined with the ease of digital publication, more
PDF <i>Traveller</I> fanzines began to arise: <i>Frontier Report</I>
(2009), ever so briefly in April 2009, then <i>Freelance Traveller
"Magazine"</I> that November. It was just an experiment when Zeitlin
published that brief zeroth isue, but the result was overwhelming
positive. As a result, it was followed by a more
comprehensive <i>Freelance Traveller #1</I> (2010) the next
January. People responded positively to the regular collections of
content, and so a new fanzine was born!

<p><i>Freelance Traveller</I> mainly consisted of new content, but
over the years it has also reprinted considerable material from other
sources. The pre-magazine web site has always been a source
of <I>Freelance Traveller</I> material, but Zeitlin has also drawn
from other websites (such as this historian's material written for
RPGnet) and in more recent years other magazines such as <i>Cepheus
Journal</I> (2020-Present) and even the Spanish-language <i>Vuelo
Raso</I> (2021-Present). Everything written for the magazine also
continues to be placed on the web site in neatly categorized topics.

<p>Originally monthly, <i>Freelance Traveller</I> shifted to a
bimonthly schedule in 2016, but doubled the size of the issues to make
up for it.

<p>As of this writing, <i>Freelance Traveller</I> as a PDF magazine
has added on another 13 years to the original 15 years
of <i>Freelancer Traveller</I> as an article-based website. Its 114
issues utterly eclipse every other fanzine or magazine ever produced
for <I>Traveller</I>. If one were to count GDW's science-fiction
magazine <i><a href="challenge.html">Challenge</a></i> (1986-1995) as a <I>Traveller</I> magazine,
it'd be the closest contender at 77 issues, including the previous run
of <a href="jtas.html"><i>Journal of the Travellers' Aid
Society</i></a> (1979-1985). However, just counting
pure <i>Traveller</i> 'zines, the closest are the 44 issues
of <i>Terra Traveller Times</I> (1987-1995), the 42 issues of <I>AAB
Proceedings</I> (1989-1999), the 36 issues of <i>Starburst</I>
(1991?-1999), and the 33 issues
of <a href="tiffanystar.html"><i>Tiffany Star</I></a>
(1988-1992). Moving away from the HIWG discussion 'zines to fanzines
more focused on polished articles, the closest is <I>Stellar
Reaches</I> (2005-2018?) at 27 issues, just a quarter of <I>Freelance
Traveller's</I> run.

<p><i>Freelancer Traveller's</I> longevity is likely largely thanks to
the fact that it's been the product of many, many writers over the
years, whereas many fanzines have been largely thanks to single
authors. But remaining an editor (and regular contributor) to such an
endeavor for such a long period is itself pheneomenal.

<h2 class="nounderline">Obtaining the Magazines</h2>

<i>Freelance Traveller</i> is freely obtainable from
the <a href="https://www.freelancetraveller.com/magazine/index.html">freelancetraveller.com
  site</a>.

<h2 class="nounderline">About the Categories</h2>

Most articles in <i>Freelance Traveller</I> are divided into several
categories. These include.

<ul>
  <li><b>Active Measures.</b> Adventures.
  <li><b>Critics' Corner.</b> Reviews.
  <li><b>Doing It My Way.</b> Rules.
  <li><b>In a Store Near You.</b> Equipment.
  <li><b>Kurishdam.</b> Details.
  <li><b>The Lab Ship.</b> Science.
  <li><b>Less Dangerous Game.</b> Animals.
  <li><b>Multimedia Gallery.</b> Creations.
  <li><b>Other Roads.</b> ATUs.
  <li><b>The Prep Room.</b> Advance prep.
  <li><b>Raconteur's Rest.</b> Fiction.
  <li><b>Up Close and Personal.</b> NPCs & Interviews.
</ul>    
    
<p>This index doesn't repeat these categories mainly because they'd be
really repetitive. However it does refer to a number of articles as
"AARs", which are "After Action Reports".

<h2 class="nounderline">About the Contents</h2>

<p>This is only a partial index. It currently covers the 2020-2023
issues of <I>Freelance Traveller</i>. It will expand backward over
time.

<p>This index is built using the ANSI A (US Letter) format. Presumably
the A4 version is identical, and likely the website version has near
identical content.


<h2 class="nounderline">About the Game Systems</h2>

<p>As with most <i>Traveller</I> fanzines, much material is
system-independent; <i>Freelance Traveller</I> also reviews classic
material for a variety of game systems. These are all noted in index
entries by a game system (or the lack thereof).

<p>Some articles were specifically written for older versions of the
game, most commonly Classic Traveller but
occasionally <i>MegaTraveller</I>. These rules editions are
specifically mentioned in the index where obvious.
  
<p>Many more articles were written for <i>Mongoose Traveller 1e</I>
(2008), <i>Mongoose Traveller 2e</I> (2016), the <i>Traveller Core
Rulebook Update 2022</I> (2021), and <i>Cepheus Engine</I>
(2016). These four game systems are all very close variants of
Mongoose's 2008 work, so trying to categorize among them is largely
meaningless.

<p>If an article contains Mongoose-related game mechanics and it
didn't originate in the <i>Cepheus Journal</I> and isn't clearly
intended for just a single version of the game system, it's classified
as "Mong/Cepheus"
