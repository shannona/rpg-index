Security Leak Is Back!
Into the Way-Back Machine
Some 14 years ago, when someone asked if you played games, chances are they wanted to know if you played pen and paper role playing games like Dungeons & Dragons or Traveller - home video game systems hadn't yet reached the amazing popularity which they have today. As a teenager at that time, I was caught up in pen-and-paper RPGs, particularly Traveller from the Game Designers' Workshop. As I became more involved in it and came into contact with more fellow Traveller fans by mail (remember, email was barely in use in those days so we wrote the old fashioned way), I came across a Traveller fanzine called Between Worlds by Magnus Abel and Fred Sobel. The thought of an amateur publication with adventures, NPCs and more had never occured to me, but I loved the idea and quickly became obsessed with doing my own. The gestation period for the Security Leak had begun.
At First It Was All About News...
Initially the Security Leak began as a simple two page (front and back) newsletter, with one entire side used for nothing more than the mailing address. Looking back, the newsletter really wasn't anything special, but given my passion for publishing something it didn't really matter much. A friend introduced me to a great Traveller espionage supplement called The SORAG Handbook of Organization and Equipment written by Chuck Kallenbach III and Don Rapp and published by their company, Paranoia Press. I liked the book so much that I appropriated the name for my own new publishing company, SORAG Laboratories, and the editorial and publishing offices were located on a small desk in the corner of my bedroom in my parents' apartment.
Finally, on December 19, 1986, Security Leak Newsletter #1 was mailed out to a handful of subscribers and cost a mere $1. But plans for something grander were still rattling around in my head. I wanted to publish a full fledged magazine with adventures, new items and more.

The Birth Of The Fanzine
However, I yearned to do something grander than a newsletter and laid the groundwork for the Security Leak Magazine, and in my spare time cobbled together the first issue. Released in 1987, issue #1 of SLM was (and I say this facetiously) a grand 12 photocopied pages beautifully bound with three high-quality aluminum staples down the far-left margin of the issue. Using only a typewriter, basic layout tools, letter transfer sheets and my own art, it wasn't beautiful but it was mine. And it was a beginning.
SLM was originally planned as a quarterly product, and in time the number of subscribers and contributing authors increased. Word of mouth helped me ultimately afford more pages and better reproductive quality by issue #2. After a while I realized that it was inappropriate to use the SORAG Laboratories name and changed it to Security Leak Publications to help promote the name of the magazine and registered the business as a DBA in Texas.

By issue #4 SLM began to slowly take on the feel of better print quality and materials. However, what still lacked was content and art. In 1988, when SLM 4 appeared, it was obvious to me and the subscribers that I was overwhelmed and the quality was suffering. I learned my first valuable lesson in publishing: don't do it all yourself. I'd had some contributors previously, but I realized that I had to detach myself from creating content and instead spend more time directing others who could create it for me.

Growth
In order to keep a regular quarterly publishing schedule and have the subscription base grow, some changes would be needed. First of all, I'd have to rely on doing less content myself. Frankly, my creative fountain felt like it had run dry and I needed a break from it. Therefore, I needed more outside writers. The art also needed a dramatic level of improvement - my primitive work would no longer suffice if I were to attract new subscribers. The layout process would also need significant streamlining - up until then I'd been doing everything manually and without the aid of desktop publishing, and it showed. I began to invest in new desktop publishing hardware and software, but on a tight budget this limited what I could do to rudimentary desktop publishing (which was used for the first time in SLM 4).
Issue 5 was in my mind a turning point for the magazine. The content took a dramatic turn for the better and to this day I'm still told that it was the best issue. Focusing on the Zhodani Eighth Core Expedition, it was the first issue to have what I consider a true full length feature with plenty of meat for adventurers to chew on. However, SLM5 didn't come without production problems - hardware problems delayed the publication by some weeks, and finances were becoming increasingly tight because of increasing publishing and mailing costs. It was at this time that I contracted artists like Phil Morrissey and Kate Lebherz-Gelinas to do artwork for future issues beginning with SLM 6. Unfortunately, my plans took a turn in a direction I didn't want - or expect - for them to go.

Implosion
Security Leak Magazine #6 was to be another major feature issue, focusing on the rising power of the Imperial noble houses following the assassination of Emperor Strephon and the resulting chaos in the shattered the Third Imperium. With the Imperium in shambles and in the absence of strong Imperial leadership, the local nobility began to take matters into their own hands. The Game Designers' Workshop (GDW) detailed some localized events, such as with Archduke Norris in the Spinward Marches sector, but there was plenty of room for more elaboration, and SLM 6 was aimed squarely at filling this void.
The cover art was done by Kate Lebherz-Gelinas, and to this day I can't be more thrilled at how it turned out, more than a decade after it was done. (Kate, if you're out there, thank you!) Phil Morrissey would also appear in SLM for the first time with his immediately identifiable style. I also wanted to further improve the entire production process by upgrading all of my desktop publishing equipment and software to ease future growth, and allow me to spend less time on production and more time on growing the business and creating supplements. But what I didn't keep a close enough eye on was the cost of all these things - expenses went up faster than revenues from subscriptions. Something had to give.

After calculating the numbers, it became obvious that Security Leak Publications was in financial trouble, and was faced with the very real possibility of going the same way that so many independent publishers had gone before it. The costs of producing a single magazine were going to be more than a subscriber paid for it - SLP was losing money fast. Without controlling the actual duplication process, or unless subscriptions reached into the thousands, I'd never be able to break even. The toughest decision I had to make up until that point had to be made: stick it out, or fold? There was no way for me to supplement subscription revenue to help keep the magazine alive, and the business was too small for a loan, so the choice became painfully clear.

In 1988, Security Leak Publications folded. It was for me the death of a dream, and the end of a passionate affair filled with creative bliss and optimism about the future. It was a very tough situation to come to grips with, but somewhere deep inside of me the desire to keep it alive still burned. It just needed the right time. And 12 years later, that time has finally come.

Meanwhile, Back At The Ranch...
After SLP closed up shop, my life continued on just as life tends to do. I continued with my university education for a while until moving back west to Oregon. (SLP was originally published in Texas and then in Georgia.) It was there that I embarked - no, stumbled into really - a new career making video games. For the next eight plus years I'd become fully involved with all things related to video games - computers became my new passion, and games my profession. I'd go from company to company, place to place, pursuing the next opportunity when it arose. At first I began at Dynamix in Oregon, and then moved on to Acclaim Entertainment in New York, Electronic Arts outside Vancouver, Canada and then to 3DO near San Francisco. During this time, a new creation came to life, which would give wings to help the Security Leak fly again. It was called the Internet.
The Rise Of The Web, The Rebirth Of The Security Leak
It didn't take long for me to realize what the Internet was going to offer the world. But what it did take me a while to realize was that it was going to be the very vehicle that would allow me to reignite my old passion, publishing the Security Leak. After all, what better means is there to reach millions of people with a minimal investment? None. All that was needed were the right conditions, and those have finally arrived. So for those of you who may have been around for the first life of the Security Leak, welcome back!
What The Future Holds
Being the pack-rat that I am, all of the original plans and materials for SLM issues 6 and 7 are still in my possession, and are currently in development for distribution via this Web site, www.securityleak.net. Tentative plans are to release a site update once per month, including new articles and ultimately new art. Because of the very nature of the site, there will be no fee for these materials - it's completely free. How's that for a bargain? Not bad, I think.
One important point is that Security Leak will be focused on the Rebellion Era universe that developed after the assassination of Emperor Strephon. For the time being, at least. The real-life Traveller world has been in upheaval for years now, passing from GDW to Imperium Games and to Far Future Enterprises. At last I heard, Marc Miller was working on a rewrite of the Traveller rules. Before I shift support over to this new system, I will need time to evaluate it first.

Issue 6 will appear soon. Entitled "Ascension of the Noble Houses", it goes into the rise in power of the local nobility that fills the vacuum left by the shattered Imperium. Naturally, the rise of these new fiefdoms and minor empires will be a happy hunting ground for adventurers. Issue 7 will focus on Traveller espionage - an area prime for adventures in the Rebellion-era Imperium. There are also other plans that have been revived, but for now the focus will be limited to getting Security Leak back into production.

Ad Astra!
Traveller has changed over the years, and had its trials and tribulations. Many considered MegaTraveller to be a big blow to the game that either alienated existing fans or kept away new fans because of its rule complexity. Traveller: The New Era was an attempt to get back to the more classical roots of Traveller, but fans didn't seem to take to it. Nor have they seemed to take to the released Traveller "T4".
So where is the Traveller community today? That's only a question that YOU, the fans, can answer. I can speak on the behalf of the Security Leak, but I cannot speak for you. Tell me what you want to see, what will help you bring your gaming group back together. Tell me what will help you interest others in getting into Traveller for the first time. Tell me what will get your attention.

I've been a Traveller fan for 16 years and I do this because it's my passion. Games are about people, and people need to interact with one another and have fun. And I know from experience that Traveller has been a vehicle for many people to have a great time with other people, to explore their imaginations, to interact, to give them something that an online Internet or computer game can't do - bring you face to face, in the flesh, with people. Tell me how I can help improve your world... Ad Astra!*

[first issue based on reprint; which is what's online]

<h2 class="nounderline">About the Contributors</h2>

Credits are somewhat problematic because they're rarely
listed. In <i>Third Imperium #X</I> (XXXX), Miek Jackson said that was
because the uncredited content was his own, and that he thought people
would get tired of seeing his name. So, that statement is taken as
fact in this index, with all uncredited articles listed as by Mike
Jackson.

<p>With that said, there were at least two poorly credited adventures
in early issues, by Aaron von Berg, something only revealed in a later
editorial. There may be other omissions of this sort, particularly in
the first three issues.
