<h1>Overview</h1>

<h2>History: 1996-1997</h2>
<div id="ToC"></div>

<p>GDW, the original publisher of <i>Traveller</I> (1977) closed up
shop on February 29, 1996. But, Traveller would not be without a
publisher for long. A new company called Imperium Games, headed by Ken
Whitman, was already on the rise. It would have <i>Marc Miller's
Traveller</I> (1996) or more colloquially <I>T4</I> out in time for
Gen Con '96.

<p>With a new game also came a new magazine, or sort of an old
magazine: Imperium decided to resurrect <i>Journal of the Travellers'
Aid Society</I>, to be edited by Jean Rabe. The magazine would pick up
the numbering from <a href="jtas.html">the original run<a/> by
starting with #25. Which made sense other than the fact
that <a href="challenge.html"><i>Challenge</I></a> magazine had
already picked up <i>JTAS'</I> numbering with #25 ‚Äî and had even
featured a special "JTAS" section with its own cover for the first
four issues.

<p>Readers were able to subscribe to Imperium's new <i>JTAS</I> for
$30 for a one-year subscription of 8 issues, with shipping free. They
were told to expect the first new issue, <i>JTAS #25</I> shortly after
the release of the rulebook. That time was eventually pinned down in
October, but months went by and there was no magazine. Some
subscribers eventually got a mailing in mid-December ... but it turned
out to be an invoice charging them an extra $11.20 for the
subscriptions they'd already purchased! Following a change in
leadership at Imperium, moneyman Solomon Courtney had decided the
magazine couldn't ship for free. (Fandom was not happy, and increasing
the price of an already sold item was likely not legal.)

<p><i>JTAS #25</I> finally came back from the printers around
Christmas 1996 and likely didn't make it to anyone until the New
Year. Meanwhile that change in Imperium's leadership had also resulted
in a brief slowdown in products, so <i>JTAS #26</I> was rescheduled
for March. It'd finally appear in the back half of May. Four
additional scheduled issues of <I>JTAS</I>, all to appear in 1997,
didn't appear that year ‚Äî and in fact would never appear, as Imperium
Games' <i>Traveller</I> license was not renewed when it expired at the
end of 1997.

<p><i>JTAS #25</I> had a number of other problems, prime among them
that a lot of its content didn't fit with the <i>Traveller</I>
universe: multiple uses of FTL radios were the most obvious canon
failure. Much like the <i>T4</I> rules themselves, it also wasn't
well-centered in the new Milieu 0 setting that Imperium was
theoretically developing. Instead, adventures were set on generic or
otherwise unknown planets with little reference to the overall
setting.

<p>Another notable problem with that first issue was that it published
at least one article without permission of the author: "One Hundred
Cargos" by Jo Grant. Though Grant had indeed submitted the article to
Imperium Games as a possibility for a supplement, and though he'd
entertained the idea of placing it instead in <i>JTAS</I>, he'd
required a contract before agreeing, which Imperium had never
supplied. Grant and BITS UK thus ultimately published <I>101
Cargos</I> (1996) as a standalone book in October for OrkCon in
Germany ... and then it showed up in <i>JTAS #25</I> as well.
  
<i>JTAS #26</I> was somewhat better received than its predecessor
(though still considered fairly average). This was likely a result of
the change in leadership at Imperium, with Whitman still being in
charge when #25 was produced and Courtney more directly in charge for
#26. The articles were more in tune with both the <I>T4</I> game
system and the Milieu 0 setting ... though some of the material was
still fairly generic. John Snead's article on The Suerrat, a minor
human race in Ilelish, had the strongest foundation in the setting,
though there was concern that it contradicted previous fan material: a
common issue in that era of both HIWG and the TML, when fans were
producing prolific content.

<p>There were also some stylistic changes between the two issues,
behind the Chris Foss artwork that fronted both. The first issue was
printed entirely black and white on stiff white paper with a color
cardstock cover, which was similar to the style of most of Imperium's
books. The second issue instead was printed on flimsy, glossy paper
with a color signature on the outside enclosing black-and-white pages
within.

<p>Despite the new leadership, <I>JTAS</i> continued to face problems
of professionalism. Six months after publication, John Snead was
asking if anyone else was having problems with late payment. It turned
out that he'd never even received a contract for his Suerrat
article. (He had however received a contract for an article for the
unpublished <i>JTAS #27</I>.)

<p>By early 1998, <i>JTAS v2</I> had officially been put on hold
because "material wasn't seen as supporting game so much as publishing
what came in." There was talk about reviving it with the publication
of <i>T4.1</I>, which was by then months over due. What wasn't known
at the time was that Imperium had already lost its <i>Traveller</I>
license at the end of 1997: it would not be renewed.
  
<p>And that's the whole story of the second <I>JTAS</I>: just two
issues over a year and a half of publication. They were quite different,
but the overall magazine tended to be rated poor to average.
