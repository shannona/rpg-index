HISTORY, 1993-PRESENT

Other Hands #1 first saw print in Spring of 1993. It was a 36 page
fanzine. Graphical presentation was fair and content was very
good. Not a lot has changed since then. As of 1998 Other Hands has
published 20 issues, averaging 4 issues a year, quite remarkable for a
fanzine. The graphical presentation has crept up a bit, with some very
nice artwork being featured, the editor, Chris Seeman, has done some
official work for ICE, and the content has perhaps gotten even a
little better, but beyond that the vision of the magazine has been
unchanged. Other Hands sets a standard of reliability in the world of
fanzines.

A NOTE ON ORGANIZATION

Almost exclusively, Other Hands is a magazine about MERP and the
background of Middle Earth.  Thus, the majority of this index is an
organization of MERP / Middle Earth topics.
