# RPG Magazine Indices
#### by [Shannon Appelcline](mailto:shannon.appelcline@gmail.com)

## About the Indices

These indices categorize articles from a variety of roleplaying
magazines, with an emphasis on indie magazines and magazines about my
favorite games, such as _Ars Magica_, _Pendragon_, _RuneQuest_, and
_Traveller_. They were written between about 1995 and the present
day. The oldest indices were written for USENET and still exist as TXT
files. More recent indices have either been written for HTML or
updated to HTML.

These indices are all released under a [cc-by-4.0
license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). That means you
can reuse them as you see fit provided you credit me. You can host
them on your own websites, incorporate them into your Wiki, print them
in your book, or anything else that meets the sole requirement of
attribution. Some of the older TXT files say they may only be used
non-commercially. That is no longer a requirement. Everything is
available under cc-by-4.0. If you need me to update a specific file to say that before you're comfortable using it [just tell me](mailto:shannon.appelcline@gmail.com).

## About the Repo

This repo exists mainly so that you (and I) can easily download these
indices to local machines and keep them up-to-date.

If you've installed GitHub on your machine, you can download the files with:
```
git clone https://github.com/shannona/rpg-index.git
```
You can later pull updated files within the `rpg-index` directory with:
```
git pull
```
### About Pull Requests

Yes, I am happy to accept pull requests to modify the content of this
repo. PRs can include, but are not limited to:

* Fixes for mistakes in the index, especially issue and page numbers.
* Additions of missing covers.
* Improvements to the CSS.
* Improvements to the HTML.
* Improvements to backgrounds.

Particularly for the CSS and HTML, my work is largely pragmatic, so
I'd be thrilled for improvements.

You may note that the one thing not on my list is indices of new
issues (or new magazines). I am very precise in my indicing, with my
style of categorization intended to be consistent across all of these
different magazines (and particularly across magazines for the same
game system). It would be very difficult for someone else to match
that style, and I'd hate to waste your work, so I don't suggest
it. But, if you think I'm wrong and you'd like to give it a shot,
please index one issue and no more and then submit a PR, and I'll tell
you what I think.

## Other Neat RPG Repos

Here's some other roleplaying-related repos that I think are aligned
with some of the topics of my roleplaying indices:

* [The Traveller Map](https://github.com/inexorabletash/travellermap) â€” source code for [travellermap.com](https://travellermap.com/)

## Supporting the RPG Indices

If you're interested in showing support for the RPG Indices, the best
things you can do are:

* Help me get ahold of magazines that I'm missing, particularly
  missing magazines or issues for my two prime focuses right now:
  Glorantha and Traveller
* Take a look at my other projects such as [the original Designers & Dragons books](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?keywords=designers++dragons&manufacturers_id=2152&x=0&y=0&author=&artist=&pfrom=&pto=) and my [Designers & Dragons patreon](https://www.patreon.com/designersanddragons) for my future works
